"""Report locals that hold a raw heap pointer across a collection point.

`scripts/raw_handle_debt.py` counts bare reads OUT OF a `RuntimeHandle` -- i.e.
debt in code that already adopted the rooting API and then degraded a use. Code
that never roots at all has no `get_raw_*_ptr` to count and scores ZERO, the
ratchet's best possible result. Its scope is `perry-runtime` only, so
`perry-stdlib` and every `perry-ext-*` crate sit outside the denominator
entirely (#8233).

This instrument detects the SHAPE instead of the API misuse:

    let state   = js_array_alloc(6);                    // binds a raw pointer
    let buffer  = js_array_alloc(0);                    // may move `state`
    consume(state);                                     // `state` is stale

A local bound from an allocator return, used again after an intervening call
that can allocate or run JS. That is the #8217 / #8163 shape, and neither the
LLVM-IR checker (blind to Rust locals) nor the root-holder census (enumerates
`static`s) can see it.

This is a REPORT, not a proof. Rust has no effect system marking "this call may
allocate", so the collection-point list is a curated denylist and the binding
detection is statement-order over source text. Expect false positives where the
allocation provably cannot trigger a collection, and false negatives wherever a
pointer flows through a shape this does not spell. The number is useful as an
EXPOSURE SURFACE -- how much of the surface no instrument is watching -- not as
a bug count.

STATEMENT-order, not line-order, since #10715: a `let` whose initializer
rustfmt wrapped onto the following lines is folded back into one statement
before matching. It used to be matched per line, so a binding broken after its
`=` -- a function of indentation depth and identifier length, not of anything
about the code -- was simply not counted. Deeply nested code, which is where
rooting bugs live, was the least scanned, and the totals were in part a measure
of formatting. Statements containing a brace are still read line by line, on
purpose: see `join_let_statement`.

`--no-raise-vs` SCANS THE WORKTREE, since #10713. It used to compare the merge
base's recorded baseline against the checked-out one and nothing else, so a
branch that added findings without touching the baseline passed it while
`--check` failed on the same tree, seconds later, in the same run.

Per CLAUDE.md, a new gate has never been green, so this ships as a report and
`--check` compares against a recorded baseline rather than demanding zero.

Usage:
    scripts/unrooted_local_shape.py                 # report
    scripts/unrooted_local_shape.py --check         # fail if above baseline
    scripts/unrooted_local_shape.py --update-baseline
    scripts/unrooted_local_shape.py --no-raise-vs <ref>
    scripts/unrooted_local_shape.py --self-test     # prove it can still fail
