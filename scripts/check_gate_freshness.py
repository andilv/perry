"""Fail when a post-merge gate has not produced a completed `main` result recently.

#7856: every heavy gate in this repo produced zero results on `main` for over two
days. They were not failing and not cancelled -- they never reached a runner, because
fourteen workflows enqueued ~29 jobs on every one of 58 daily merges against a repo
that runs ~9 jobs at a time. Five collector-touching PRs merged inside that window and
#7843's seven genuinely-red rows landed unseen.

The reason it lasted two days is the part worth engineering against: **the failure is
silent by construction.** An empty result set looks exactly like a healthy one that
nobody has looked at. Rescheduling the gates
(docs/src/testing/ci-gate-scheduling.md) does not fix that -- a cron that quietly
stops firing fails in precisely the same way. This script is the detector for both.

For each gate in scripts/gate_freshness.json it asks the Actions API for the most
recent COMPLETED run on the default branch, and fails when that result is older than
the gate's budget. The age starts when the run completed, not when it entered the
queue: a run that waited twelve hours and finished now is fresh evidence that the gate
reached a runner.

Two things it deliberately does NOT count as evidence of health:

  * **pull_request runs.** PR runs supersede each other and therefore drain even when
    the queue is saturated. Counting them is exactly what made `gc-root-dominance`
    look healthy in #7856 while its `main` arm had been dark for two days.
  * **runs that merely exist.** `queued`, `in_progress`, `cancelled` and `skipped`
    runs are not results. A gate with 22 queued `main` runs and no completed one is a
    dark gate, which is the whole point.

A completed failure DOES count as fresh. Its own red workflow run is the failure
signal; classifying it as starvation too conflates two independent diagnoses. This is
especially important for advisory workflows such as npm publish freshness, whose live
check deliberately fails and maintains its own issue while the registry is behind.

Usage:
    python3 scripts/check_gate_freshness.py --self-test   # prove it can still fail
    python3 scripts/check_gate_freshness.py --dry-run     # real API, no issue writes
    python3 scripts/check_gate_freshness.py               # CI gate
