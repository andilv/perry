# End-to-end exercised arm for the #7154 rooting-bug instruments
# (`PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE`, `PERRY_GC_ZEAL`).
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
#
# CLAUDE.md's GC knob kill-policy is binding: a knob with no arm exercising it
# is a configuration nobody has verified, and this repo has repeatedly paid for
# that (`PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` inert for every `gc()`-driven test, #6942 /
# #6946; the matrix's `--pressure` knob disabling the path it measured, #7024).
#
# The *detection* property — "a planted stale from-space deref is caught" — is
# asserted as a unit test in the required `cargo-test` gate
# (`gc/tests/fromspace_protect.rs::quarantine_catches_a_planted_stale_from_space_deref`).
# What a unit test cannot cover is the INTEGRATED path: codegen actually
# emitting back-edge polls, zeal actually firing on them, the copying minor
# actually running, and the quarantine actually retiring its from-space in a
# real compiled program. That is this script.
#
# NON-VACUITY IS THE POINT. Per CLAUDE.md's "four ways a gate can be unable to
# fail" #4, a gate must assert its subject was live. A protected run with zero
# copying minors protects nothing and would pass silently. So this script does
# not merely check the program's output: it requires the zeal arm to produce
# strictly MORE quarantine retirements than the no-zeal arm, which can only
# happen if zeal genuinely forced collections that pressure would not have.
#
# Usage: scripts/gc_instrument_smoke.sh [path-to-perry]
#   Expects target/release/perry and PERRY_RUNTIME_DIR-resolvable staticlibs.

# (`gc evacuation verification failed: stale forwarded pointer in ...`) and
# nothing in CI would have said a word.
#
# Deliberately NOT routed through gc_repsel_matrix.sh: a `zeal_verify` arm
# registered there joins EVERY corpus file via `--arms all`, and #7254's own
# sizing sweep (59 files) found a striking concentration of multi-minute-plus
# runs under this exact pairing on the test_gap_gc_* reproducer corpus --
# ZEAL forces a full evacuating minor at EVERY back-edge poll, which no other
# matrix arm does, so a corpus built for arms that collect only when a real
# trigger fires is not this pairing's natural home. That population is not
# yet triaged (host contention during the investigation made timeout vs.
# genuine-cost vs. host-noise undecidable) and is out of scope for this fix;

# ---- arm 6: zeal must TERMINATE at the shipped default (#7728) --------------

# Every arm above runs the ~1200-poll fixture, which is deliberately tiny
# ("costs seconds rather than minutes"). That sizing is exactly why this gate
# could not see #7728: zeal forced a collection at EVERY back-edge poll, and on
# a small enough fixture that is indistinguishable from a paced instrument. The
# moment #7721 turned back-edge polls on by default, the same instrument cost
# ~511 us per loop iteration on real code -- 24 minutes for a 19 s program, i.e.
# an instrument nobody can switch on, with nothing in CI to say so.
#
# This arm runs a workload with a realistic poll count at the DEFAULT stride
# (note the explicit `env -u` -- the export at the top of this file pins
# every-poll mode for the small fixture, which would defeat the whole point
# here).
#
# THE DISCRIMINATOR IS THE RATIO, NOT THE CLOCK, and that is a deliberate
# choice rather than an oversight. Measured on the quiet host, this fixture is
# 0.49 s paced against 11.85 s unpaced -- a real 24x, but both fit inside any
# budget loose enough not to flake on a shared CI runner, so a wall-clock
# assertion here would be decoration. `forced_collections` vs `loop_polls` is
# host-independent and exact: the regression's signature is one forced
# collection per poll (measured 200,069 for 200,064), and the shipped default
# is 1-in-40. The 4x threshold below sits between them with room for a future
# default anywhere up to 1-in-4.
#
# The wall-clock budget is kept as the weaker "does it terminate AT ALL" guard,
# sized generously on purpose.
