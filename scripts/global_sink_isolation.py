"""Every table the GC test guards CLEAR must be out of reach of another test.

WHY THIS EXISTS (#7672)
-----------------------
`gc::tests::support::reset_copying_nursery_runtime_test_state()` runs from
`GcTestIsolationGuard` and `CopyingNurseryTestGuard`, on whatever libtest thread
happens to construct one, and calls ~20 `test_clear_*` helpers that empty
PROCESS-global side tables. The guards serialize against each other, and against
the handful of tests that remember to take
`crate::gc::global_side_table_test_lock()`. Nothing requires a *reader* to take
it, so the defence is opt-in and the opt-in is invisible at the read site.

Three flakes in two days came from exactly that, each exposed by an unrelated PR
that changed the parallel schedule, and each diagnosed from the wrong VALUE
rather than the timing:

  #7665  opt_report's row sink        `rows.len() == 2` failed at 3
  #7665  ext_registry USED_PROVIDERS  "empty" failed with `ioredis` present
  #7671  closure CLOSURE_PROPS        a static method read back TAG_UNDEFINED

The fix is per-thread storage in test builds (`per_test_global!`), because
the damage window is "between this test's write and this test's read" and only
the test knows that span — a lock the accessor takes for one call does not cover
it, and a lock the test takes is the opt-in the class is made of.

WHAT THIS SCRIPT ASSERTS
------------------------
It derives the clear list from the guards' own source, resolves the storage
behind every helper, and classifies each `static` it writes to:

  * `thread_local!`                 -> safe by construction
  * `per_test_global!`         -> per-thread in test builds, safe
  * `RealmAtomicI64` / `RealmAtomicU64` -> immutable handle to a
    `perry_thread_local!` backing slot, safe
  * a bare `static`                 -> HAZARD

A hazard fails the build unless it is named in ALLOWLIST below with the issue
that blocks it — and an allowlist entry that matches nothing ALSO fails, so an
entry cannot outlive its cause. The burden lands on the ~20 table authors, who
are finite and gated, instead of on the ~180 readers, who are not.

# #10944: the SECOND class — a process-global counter a TEST ASSERTS ON.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# The rule above covers tables the GC guards CLEAR. It does not cover the much
# larger population of process-global counters that tests read directly, and
# that population is why `cargo test -p perry-runtime` cannot attribute a
# regression today:
#
#     --test-threads=1   4215 passed;  0 failed
#     parallel (x6)      4198-4205 passed; 10-17 failed, a DIFFERENT set each run
#
# ZERO genuine failures. Every failure the suite produces is one test's
# assertion disturbed by another test's increment, and it always presents the
# same way -- off by exactly one:
#
#     assertion `left == right` failed: ... reuse the prior negative verdict
#       left: 2, right: 1
#
# The premise was written down in `json_tape/cached_read.rs`:
#
#     // The runtime suite is serial. This witness holds no managed values.
#     static ROOTED_READS: AtomicU32 = AtomicU32::new(0);
#
# It is not serial. libtest runs tests in one process across many threads.
#
# WHY A RATCHET AND NOT A SWEEP
# -----------------------------
# The population is not enumerable by inspection -- six parallel runs after
# three modules were converted still produced 17 distinct failures, including
# names no earlier run had shown. Converting every one at a time means editing
# modules owned by several lanes at once. So this records today's set and
# fails only on ADDITIONS, exactly like `raw_handle_debt.py` and
# `unrooted_local_shape.py`: existing entries get converted by whoever owns
# each file, opportunistically, and no new instance can arrive quietly.
#
# `per_test_global!` is the fix for an entry, and its own module docs are the
# justification: "a new sink cannot be added quietly, and a new *reader* never
# has to remember anything." #7665, #7671, #7672 and #7975 are the first four
# instances of this class; #10944 is the fifth, which is the argument for a
# gate rather than a fifth patch.
#
# OUT OF SCOPE: the timing-shaped family (`child_process::reactor`, `pty`,
# `stdlib_pump`) fails under load on a shared box and has nothing to do with
# shared counters. It needs its own triage and must not be swept in here.
