"""Representation-selection promotion census (#7106).

Perry's performance story rests on six unboxed representations. Until #7034
nobody knew how many values each one actually promotes on real code, because
nothing reported it: an agent had to hand-instrument the compiler to discover
that `Ptr<Shape>` promotes **nothing at all** on `batch.ts` — the
object/property-heavy program the representation exists for. Independently
confirmed: `PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_LOCALS=0` and the default produce a byte-identical
binary.

This module turns that into a standing, gated measurement. It runs
`perry compile --opt-report=json --no-link` over a corpus, extracts a
**per-representation** count of promotions per workload, and compares each
count against a ratcheted floor.

## Why the counts are per representation, never aggregated

The interesting signal in #7034 is that `Ptr<Shape>` is 0 *while* canonical
`Str` is nonzero. One aggregate number hides exactly that. So the census keys
on the representation, splitting `canonical-slot` into its three reps
(`I32`/`U32`/`Str`) and counting `TaPtr` parameter slots inside specialized-ABI
entries.

## Why a floor and not a diff

CLAUDE.md, "Four ways a gate can be unable to fail", case 4: *the gate runs but
its subject never did*. A census that faithfully reports `Ptr<Shape>: 0` and
exits green is worth nothing — that is the state the project is in today. So:

1. Every workload carries a **floor** per representation. A count below its
   floor is red. `--update` rewrites floors from observation.
2. Floors alone are not enough, because today's honest floor for
   `Ptr<Shape>` on real code *is* zero, and a zero floor can never fail. So
   the corpus includes **liveness fixtures**: hand-written programs that must
   promote a specific representation. Their minimums live in
   [`LIVENESS_FLOORS`] — **in this file, not in the baseline JSON** — so that
   re-running `--update` after a breakage cannot silently write them down to
   zero and leave a permanently-green gate behind.
3. A representation whose census key is nonzero *nowhere* in the corpus fails
   the run outright ([`check_instrument_liveness`]). A counter that is zero
   because nothing was promoted and a counter that is zero because nobody
   increments it look identical in a report; this distinguishes them.

Point 2 is what makes the gate falsifiable in both directions:
`PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_LOCALS=0` takes the `ptr_shape` fixture to zero and the run
goes red, while the default build is green.

## What this census can and cannot see

It counts what `--opt-report` (#6952) records, which is the set of analyses in
`perry_codegen::opt_report::Analysis::ALL`. Two things are deliberately out of
scope and are **not** silently reported as zero:

- The masked-window / buffer-view `TaPtr` *region* machinery
  (`stmt/masked_window_region.rs`) is region-shaped rather than a per-value
  promotion, and has no `opt_report` analysis. `spec-abi-taptr-slot` covers
  `TaPtr` only in its specialized-ABI *parameter* form.
- Denials are recorded as context (`candidates`) but never gated: the count of
  values a rule rejected is a property of the corpus, not of the compiler.

#: The two were conflated until #7107 read the emitted IR by hand and found
#: that `batch.ts` reports two `Ptr<Shape>` promotions and applies exactly one:
#: `totals` is proven, reported as a win, and keeps the guarded diamond at
#: every access site. The whole 1,532-byte binary saving came from the other.
#:
#: This table is why the census does not simply grow a `-consumed` column for
#: every representation. An uninstrumented analysis would report `consumed: 0`,
#: which is indistinguishable from "instrumented and never applied" — the exact
#: ambiguity this census exists to remove, reintroduced one level down. So
#: `consumed` is reported ONLY for analyses that record it, and
#: [`check_consumption_instrumentation`] fails if the compiler starts emitting
#: consumption for an analysis this table does not know about.
