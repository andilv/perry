# Committed runner for the Perry "gap" suite.
#
# Every test-files/test_gap_*.ts is AOT-compiled by Perry and diffed
# byte-for-byte against `node --experimental-strip-types`. This is a thin
# wrapper over run_parity_tests.sh --filter test_gap_ so it reuses the ONE
# canonical normalizer, the skip-list, the per-test output cap, and the JSON
# report (this shared-normalizer reuse is the seed of roadmap initiative I-14).
#
# Replaces the out-of-repo /tmp/run_gap_tests.sh that CLAUDE.md used to point
# at — the gap suite is the highest-signal-per-second test Perry has and was
# previously dark in CI.
#
# Regression-gate semantics: exits non-zero on ANY divergence from the
# committed snapshot in test-parity/gap_snapshot.json — a test that started
# failing, a test that started passing, or one the oracle stopped covering.
# (run_parity_tests.sh's own exit code only trips below 80% AGGREGATE parity,
# which is far too loose to catch a single-feature regression — exactly the
# "a module silently went to 0 behind a green build" class.)
#
# Accept the current state with `UPDATE_SNAPSHOT=1 ./scripts/run_gap_tests.sh`
# and commit the snapshot diff. The old known_failures.json gate only looked
# for NEW failures, so a fixed test kept its entry forever (#797); checking
# both directions makes an orphaned entry impossible.
#
# Requirements:
#   - a Rust toolchain (the wrapped run_parity_tests.sh builds target/release/perry)
#   - node with --experimental-strip-types, at the .node-version pin
#   - jq, Python 3 (`python3` or `python`)
#
# Usage: scripts/run_gap_tests.sh [--shard N/M]
#        UPDATE_SNAPSHOT=1 scripts/run_gap_tests.sh   # accept current state
