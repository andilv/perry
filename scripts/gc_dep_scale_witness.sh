# The DEPENDENCY-SCALE RUNTIME witness for the moving collector (#7717, the one
# unmet ask of #7280).
#
# Reproduce a CI failure with exactly this, from the repo root:
#
#   npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund
#   cargo build --release -p perry -p perry-runtime-static -p perry-stdlib-static
#   ./scripts/gc_dep_scale_witness.sh
#
# The env knobs live HERE and not in the YAML on purpose: a retyped invocation
# that drops one of them produces a run that exits 0 while witnessing nothing,
# which is the failure this file exists to prevent.
#
# WHY A RUNTIME WITNESS, WHEN TWO STATIC GATES ALREADY COMPILE THIS CORPUS
#
# `gc-root-dominance` compiles `test-files/gc-dep-corpus/` and checks the
# emitted LLVM IR. That cannot see a runtime-side cache holding a raw heap
# pointer — `scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py` reads IR, and a `static` or
# `thread_local!` in perry-runtime is structurally invisible to it. The #7154
# class is also invisible to every runtime GC probe AT the collection, because
# there is nothing for the collector to find; it surfaces cycles later, in a
# different function, as `TypeError: value is not a function`.
#
# So the only instrument that can observe it is: run real dependency-shaped code
# under a collector that relocates constantly, with the from-space quarantine
# armed deep enough that a stale pointer faults at the faulting instruction
# instead of silently reading recycled bytes.
#
# WHY DEPENDENCY-SCALE RATHER THAN A FIXTURE. #7280 measured it: the curated
# 25-file corpus passed 25/25 while twenty lines of stock `zod` failed 5/40. It
# is a distribution problem, not a size one — the dependency-scale corpus is
# dominated by `js_object_assign_one` (object spread) and
# `js_new_function_construct`, populations the curated files barely produce.
#
# WHAT MAKES THIS ABLE TO FAIL (CLAUDE.md's four ways a gate cannot)
#
#   1. No `continue-on-error`, no `|| true`, no pipe between a producer and its
#      check — every command's status is the gate's status (`set -euo pipefail`).
#   2. It asserts its SUBJECT RAN, three independent ways, and any one of them
#      missing is a hard failure:
#        * the `[gc-schedule]` exit verdict, which since #7604 (ported to the
#          seeded schedule by #7741) makes the binary itself exit 70 when a
#          rate-1 run forced no collection or relocated
#          nothing — so a vacuous run is red without this script's help;
#        * `copying_minors` and `loop_polls` are re-read here anyway, because
#          "the binary would have exited 70" is a claim about a version of the
#          binary, and this gate should not depend on that staying true;
#        * `[gc-fromspace-protect] retired_set=#N`, because
#          `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE=1` on a run with no copying minor
#          protects NOTHING and still exits clean. #7717 records hitting exactly
#          that and nearly recording the wrong conclusion.
#   3. The answer is compared against the same binary run WITHOUT the schedule. A stale
#      root corrupts values, so identical output across the two is the property
#      that matters. (It is not diffed against node: the corpus imports zod by
#      SOURCE PATH — `node_modules/zod/src/index.js` resolving to `.ts` — which
#      is what makes its modules native to Perry and what node cannot resolve.)
#   4. Promotion to a required context is deliberately NOT done here; a new gate
#      has never been green, so it is observed on `main` first.
#
# DEPTH 800 IS NOT A ROUND NUMBER. `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH` bounds how
# many retired page-sets stay quarantined, and the default of 4 is far too small
# for real code: #7154's own reproducer needed 800 because the value crossed 600
# polls between its last valid observation and its stale use. Measured on this
# workload the quarantine runs saturated — `sets_held=800/800` — so the depth is
# load-bearing rather than decorative, and lowering it silently narrows the
# window in which a stale dereference can still be caught.

# what emits `[gc-fromspace-protect]`, i.e. the only evidence that the
# quarantine engaged at all, and it is one of the three things this gate
# asserts. The matrix can afford to let the auto-optimizer choose because it
# re-reads whichever trace format it gets; this witness cannot, because a
# stripped runtime removes its evidence rather than changing its shape.
#
# The assertions below are fail-closed, so a stripped runtime would go red
# rather than quietly pass — but red-for-the-wrong-reason is still a broken
# gate, and the relink also costs minutes of CI on every run.
