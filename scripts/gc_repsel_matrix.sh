# GC x representation-selection stress matrix.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------
# The representation-selection campaign shipped several new value
# representations (canonical unboxed i32 locals #6903, tagged-at-rest `Str`
# #6909, `Ptr<Shape>` #6911, `Ptr<NumArray>` #6915/#6916, spec-ABI raw params
# #6905, native-i32 residency #6898). Each made its own GC-safety argument in
# its own PR, verified once by hand at merge time. Meanwhile the collector
# changed underneath all of them (#6910 mark/rewrite root-word parity, #6921
# typed-shape layout on the ctor exit, #6892 minor-sweep finalization, #6655
# operand rooting). Nobody verified the cross-product. This script is that
# cross-product, as a maintained gate.
#
# ***LIVENESS IS PART OF THE RESULT.***
# Setting a GC env var does not prove the GC did anything (#6942, #6946, #6950).
# Measured on main: the whole representation corpus performs ZERO collections --
# the first-GC trigger needs ~1M escaping allocations and a gap test allocates a
# few KB. So every GC arm is INERT against it, and "passes under
# PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE=1" asserts nothing.
#
# Therefore every run is executed with `PERRY_GC_TRACE=1` (one `[gc] cycle`
# marker per completed collection -- a sound cycle counter) and `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1`
# (`moved_objects=` / `[gc-copy-minor] ran` -- evacuation evidence), and each
# cell is reported as one of:
#
#   PASS   output byte-exact vs the pinned Node oracle AND the arm's liveness
#          requirement was met on this test
#   UNVER  output byte-exact but the arm was INERT here (no collection, or
#          nothing moved for an evacuating arm) -- NOT green, by design
#   XFAIL  a triaged, justified expected-red (test-parity/gc_repsel_triage.txt)
#   FAIL   output mismatch, crash, non-zero exit, or compile failure
#
# A cell that matched the oracle under an inert arm is UNVER, never PASS. A
# matrix of green cells from inert arms would license exactly the false
# confidence this gate exists to remove.
#
# `test_gap_repsel_gc_stress` is the corpus member deliberately built to be
# LIVE (measured: 2 collections at default settings, 11 under `--pressure 8`).
# If a collector change stops it collecting, its cells go UNVER and the arm
# liveness summary shows 0/N -- that is the signal to re-tune its churn budget.
#
# ADDING A REPRESENTATION: register its gap file in
# test-parity/gc_repsel_corpus.txt. This script FAILS if a `test_gap_repsel_*`
# or `test_gap_specabi_*` file exists that is not registered (see
# docs/representation-selection-rfc.md 5.6).
#
# Portable to bash 3.2 (macOS system bash): no associative arrays, no mapfile.

# Arms.  Format:  id | compile-env | run-env | liveness-requirement | note
#
# liveness requirement:
#   scavenge the arm claims the COPYING MINOR runs -> require
#            `[gc-copy-minor] ran copied_objects=` > 0. Strictly stronger than
#            `move`, which the C4b mark-sweep evacuation satisfies on its own
#            (#7025) -- `default` reported `moved=7 610 512` while running zero
#            copying minors. Any arm whose subject is the relocating young-gen
#            minor #7019 shipped must use THIS, not `move`.
#   move     the arm claims to evacuate -> require moved/copied objects > 0
#   collect  the arm claims to collect  -> require at least one GC cycle
#   none     no GC claim of its own (an explicit control)
#
# %P% expands to the pressure env (PERRY_GC_HEAP_LIMIT=<MB>) unless
# --pressure 0. `-` means "no run env at all". Compile-time vars change emitted
# IR; all of them are keyed into the object cache
# (perry/src/commands/compile/object_cache.rs), so arms never silently share
# cached objects.
#
# %E% expands to THE EVACUATING BASE (#6950):
#
#     PERRY_GC_INCREMENTAL=0 PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=off
#
# Every arm whose requirement is `move` carries it, because without it those
# arms are INERT and were reported UNVER across the whole corpus. Two
# independent blockers, both measured:
#
#   1. `PERRY_GC_INCREMENTAL=0`. With incremental mode on (the default),
#      `registered_root_scanners_block_budgeted_gc()` reduces to "any copy-only
#      scanner", which a compiled program has none of. So `gc_check_trigger`
#      skips the direct-collection arm and hands the trigger to the budgeted
#      stepper, whose mutator assists never drive the cycle to completion.
#      Turning incremental off restores the direct synchronous minor.
#   2. `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=off`. The direct arm takes
#      `ManualGcScanGuard::force_full_scan()`, and a forced conservative scan
#      makes the copying minor ineligible (`fallback=conservative_stack`) --
#      the exact sentence #6950 quotes from `gc/policy.rs`. An explicit env
#      value BEATS that guard in `conservative_stack_scan_mode()`, so this is
#      what turns the automatic collection into a precise-rooted copying minor
#      that actually relocates survivors.
#
# Measured on this pair (`--pressure 8`, arm `evac_minor`):
#   test_gap_repsel_canonical_i32     0 cycles -> 1 cycle,  4 579 objects copied
#   test_gap_repsel_ptr_shape_locals  0 cycles -> 1 cycle,  4 640 objects copied
#   test_gap_repsel_gc_stress        24 cycles -> 31 cycles, 1 556 543 copied
# every one with `[gc-copy-minor] eligible=true fallback=none`.
#
# NOTE this is a MEASUREMENT configuration, not the shipped one. It says the
# collector's evacuating path is exercised; it does not say the shipped default
# reaches that path.
#
# ***AS OF #7024 THE SHIPPED DEFAULT DOES REACH IT*** -- by the sound route,
# which is not this one. `default` (pressure knob only, no GC env) now defers
# the alloc-point trigger to a precise-root safepoint and runs the copying
# minor there. Measured on this corpus at `--pressure 8`:
#
#   arm            copy-minor before #7024   after
#   default              0/22                12/22
#   verify_evac          0/22                12/22
#
# The difference between `default` and %E% is now WHERE the relocation happens:
# `default` relocates at a real safepoint (the JS stack has unwound, roots are
# precise by construction), %E% forces it at the register-imprecise allocation
# point. Both belong in the matrix; only the first is a configuration anyone
# ships.
#
# ***AND IT IS RED.*** The first `--arms all` run in which anything actually
# moved failed 14 of the 20 corpus files: 5 crashes and 9 output mismatches
# (#6981), plus one intermittent SIGSEGV that does not even need precise roots
# (#6982). The discriminator is NOT relocation -- with the conservative stack
# scan still on, the same evacuating cycles pass 19/20 while copying thousands
# of objects. It is precise roots: the values only the conservative scan was
# keeping alive. That is the finding this gate was built to produce, and the
# arms stay configured to keep producing it. Do not quiet them down.

#
# ***THIS SUBSET CAN NOW REPRODUCE THE RELOCATING-MINOR DEFECT CLASS (#6993).***
# Until #7024 it could not, and that was the hole: `default` and `verify_evac`
# ran the NON-moving alloc-point minor (the deferral to the precise-root
# safepoint was unreachable whenever the pressure knob was set, because the
# deferral cap and the trigger ceiling shared a formula), and `cons_scan_off`
# relocated only with incremental mode still on. So the whole "raw reference
# held across a relocating collection" class -- #6951, #6972, #6982, #6991,
# #6992 -- was invisible per PR and could only go red after merge, on push.
#
# The proof that the hole is closed is a cell that changed colour, not an
# argument: `default x test_gap_repsel_p4a3_numarray_barriers` was PASS
# (`cycles=1 scavenged=0` -- it collected, and relocated nothing) and is now
# FAIL (`exit=139 scavenged=3594`) -- the same SIGSEGV that only `cons_scan_off`
# and the %E% arms could produce before. #6981's redness now reaches the arm
# named after the shipped configuration.
#
# `evac_minor` AND `force_verify` ARE BACK IN, as the previous revision of this
# comment instructed. They were held out only while #6981 was red. It is fixed:
# the memoized `Array.prototype` address is a raw pointer to a MOVABLE object,
# so a relocation (`js_array_grow` or the copying minor) left the hole-read
# fallback's `proto != receiver` self-recursion guard comparing a from-space
# address against a forwarding-resolved one; the guard stopped firing and the
# mutator recursed until the stack guard page. Measured on the fix,
# `--arms all --pressure 8`: PASS=339 UNVER=100 XFAIL=1 FAIL=0 over 440 cells,
# with both arms at copy-minor 21/22 (was PASS=325 … FAIL=14). So "a
# representation regressed GC correctness under relocation" is now a per-PR
# signal on the arms that actually relocate, which is the whole reason this
# matrix exists. The single XFAIL is the pre-existing
# `repsel_ptr_shape_locals x rep_ptr_shape_off` entry (#6976), not in this
# subset.
