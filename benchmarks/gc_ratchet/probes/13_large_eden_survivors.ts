// GC ratchet probe: a survivor cohort carried across LARGE, INFREQUENT
// copying minors.
//
// gc-ratchet-env: PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB=64
//
// Every other probe in this suite runs at the shipped 16 MB nursery cap, so
// every copying minor they exercise is small and frequent. #7472/#7481 both
// faulted at a *non-default* cap and neither was reachable from this matrix:
// #7481 is deterministic at `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB=64`, absent at 1, 4,
// 16 and 32, and its own issue names the missing coverage — "a live
// copying-minor correctness signal at exactly the cadence the ratchet probes
// never exercise". This probe is that cadence, pinned.
//
// Why the cadence is a different collector, not merely a slower one:
//
//   * a minor at 64 MB has ~4x the Eden to scan and copies a survivor cohort
//     that has had ~4x as long to accumulate, so the copy loop, the survivor
//     semispace sizing and the promotion decision all run at magnitudes the
//     16 MB probes never reach;
//   * `gc/tenuring.rs` sizes the target survivor occupancy as a fraction of
//     the *effective* cap and scales that cap from measured influx, so a
//     larger base lands on a different point of both policies;
//   * a reference that survives N collections at 16 MB survives ~N/4 at 64 MB,
//     which is what moves a missed reference rewrite from "faults on the next
//     cycle" to "faults much later, somewhere else".
//
// What the workload holds across those minors, in the shape the two faults
// took — a slot in a long-lived object pointing at a young object that the
// copying minor relocates:
//
//   * `keep` is a survivor cohort that outlives every collection;
//   * `keep[j].note` takes a pointer to a *freshly allocated* object every
//     256th iteration, so the remembered set and the old-to-young rewrite are
//     exercised at every minor rather than only at the start;
//   * `keep[j].peer` is an intra-cohort edge, so the cohort is a graph and not
//     a flat array the collector can walk in allocation order;
//   * `tag` is a heap string, so a survivor carries a pointer the rewrite must
//     follow into a different object kind;
//   * the verification phase reads all four back and folds them into the
//     `hits`/`tagChars`/`peerIds`/`notes`/`noteSum` lines, every one of which
//     is diffed byte-for-byte against Node. A missed rewrite therefore has to
//     either fault or produce a wrong number; it cannot pass quietly.
//
// Metric contract as everywhere else: stdout carries only `probe:`/`checksum:`
// style lines, `#gcmetric` goes to stderr.

declare function gc(): void;

// KEEP is sized for the *pacing*, not for the workload. `gc/policy.rs`'s
// `arena_growth_full_escalation_due` escalates a minor to a full mark-sweep
// once arena in-use clears 32 MB AND exceeds twice the post-full baseline, so a
// large Eden on top of a *small* retained set escalates every collection and
// runs zero copying minors — the arm would be pinned on a collector it never
// reached. A ~30 MB retained set holds the baseline high enough that a 64 MB
// Eden is not a doubling, which is what leaves the copying minor reachable.
// Measured on the pinned host at v0.5.1376: KEEP 8,192 -> 0 copying minors,
// 131,072 -> 1, 262,144 -> 4 (freeing 37, 36, 68 and 68 MB; 49.7 MB per minor,
// against 14.6-16.6 MB on eleven of the twelve default-cap probes and 21.8 MB
// on 12_large_live_set). `check`'s liveness rule is what keeps that honest: a
// shape that stopped reaching the copying minor cannot be pinned.
