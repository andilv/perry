# Correct source reuse for lazy stringify

Main `eee3881c4` and the tape-depth candidates copy untouched lazy-array source
without proving canonical string spelling or property enumeration. The original
[diagnostic](results/lazy-canonical-probe/README.md) demonstrates five inherited
failures: whitespace, Unicode escapes, slash escapes, duplicate keys and reversed
integer-like keys. Ordinary direct parsing produces the correct output.

R1 (`96df018b1e436d52aefc0eca8a55fcb5df5e2ee4`) validates compact separators,
canonical strings, unique keys and numeric-key ordering before source copying.
Ambiguous cases materialize before ordinary stringify. Admission uses only native
scratch and introduces no managed intermediate values or collector-policy changes.
All 297 JSON tests and 126 compiled candidate checks pass; additional main controls
expose escaped/nested duplicates and index-after-name ordering as inherited bugs.
[Validation, raw output and moving-GC witnesses](results/lazy-canonical-r1-validation/README.md).

R1 is parked because its [quiet focused replay](results/quiet-lazy-canonical-r1-main-focus-r9/README.md)
shows 87–101% slower record roundtrips than main and 119–144% slower than tape-depth
R2. All three sizes have 9/9 slower pairs. The eager heterogeneous stringify concern
remains +0.427% versus main; that benchmark forces eager parsing and does not use
this shortcut. R1 has not received full performance matrices or acceptance.

A local stack-location sample places 801 of 1,454 main-thread samples under the
new proof. The next candidate should combine proof and number normalization,
validate UTF-8 once, and compare fixed-width separators directly. No resulting
speedup is claimed yet. Source-string reuse additionally requires shared ownership
(`StringHeader.refcount == 0`), a complete source span and borrowed normalized output.
The standard record fixtures contain spellings such as `0.0`, so their normalization
produces owned output: whole-source reuse would not accelerate those rows.

## R2 combined traversal: still parked

R2 (`c812afd4841e79970d298f7b4ff9b97c9d8888ab`) combines proof and number
normalization, validates UTF-8 once, compares separators directly and derives
string ends from adjacent token offsets. It passes 298 JSON tests and all 162
compiled candidate comparisons, including deep and wide fallback cases.
[Validation and moving-GC witnesses](results/lazy-canonical-r2-validation/README.md).

Its [quiet focused replay](results/quiet-lazy-canonical-r2-main-focus-r9/README.md)
reduces the recorded record-roundtrip slowdowns to 28–36% versus main, compared
with 87–101% in the separate R1 window. It remains 50–65% slower than the current
PR build and is not accepted. Eager heterogeneous stringify remains +0.434%
versus main; the 13 KiB roundtrip has a 624 KiB median peak RSS increase.

The fresh local profile points to the scalar quote/backslash tail loop: the
prominent +1388/+1400 offsets are a byte load and character comparisons, not a
key-table lookup. The next bounded experiment should apply the existing padded
word scanner to short lazy-string bodies/tails while preserving the general
parser scanners. Validate every byte position and guard-page boundary before
measuring. Native output allocation/copying is a later target; no new output
ownership, global cache or GC-policy change has been implemented.

## R3 padded short tails: still parked

R3 (`6cb0854eb50837495d7ab67aa7c6c749f544dbf1`) uses packed four-to-seven-byte
tails only in the lazy canonical-string scan. General parser scanner entry points
retain their existing specialization. All 298 JSON tests and 162 compiled candidate
comparisons pass, including guard-page and moving-GC coverage.
[Validation and exact code](results/lazy-canonical-r3-validation/README.md).

The [qualified focused replay](results/quiet-lazy-canonical-r3-main-focus-r9/README.md)
keeps record roundtrips 25–34% slower than main and 46–62% slower than the PR build.
All three sizes have 9/9 slower pairs. Eager heterogeneous stringify is +0.381%
versus main (8/9 slower pairs). The source remains parked; no full matrix is justified.

A next candidate could retain the plain/escaped string fact already discovered
while building the native tape, avoiding a second body scan during stringify.
That requires a complete tape-metadata consumer audit and parse-only, sparse and
full-scan measurements: moving work into parsing must not hide its cost. No such
metadata change is included here. Canonicalization and eager stringify performance
remain separate unresolved issues, and parity with both engines is still incomplete.

## R4 native escape metadata: still parked

R4 (`8a7a29d72dd10d1ab51e3a34108cce9487bd2f3f`) retains the plain-string fact
in existing native tape leaf metadata. The entry layout and GC policy stay the
same; unknown metadata preserves the full checked scan. All 304 release JSON
tests and 162 compiled candidate comparisons pass.
[Validation and metadata audit](results/lazy-canonical-r4-validation/README.md).

The [qualified eight-case replay](results/quiet-lazy-canonical-r4-main-focus-r9/README.md)
still measures record roundtrips 15–22% slower than main and 34–47% slower than the
PR build, with 9/9 slower pairs. The added 1 MiB parse/scan/sparse controls cost
+1.687%/+0.818%/+1.432% versus the PR build. The earlier tape-depth gains keep them
faster than main, but R4's incremental cost remains unacceptable. Source is parked;
only evidence is included in PR #10036. No full matrix is justified.

The local profile now exposes the duplicate-key slice loop and string endpoint
checks in normalization. A bounded next experiment could skip the duplicate
loop when a native per-object length-bit summary proves no preceding key has that
length, retaining exact comparison on all collisions. This is a hypothesis only.
The early tape-entry push also needs reconsideration because parse-only costs
increased. No new implementation or speed claim exists for either follow-up.
