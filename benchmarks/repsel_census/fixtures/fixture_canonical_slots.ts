// Liveness fixture for the three canonical-slot census keys (#7106):
// `canonical-i32`, `canonical-u32` and `canonical-str`.
//
// These are the reps `expr/slot_rep.rs` selects. Splitting them into three
// census keys rather than one `canonical-slot` aggregate is deliberate: on
// `batch.ts` the ONLY promotion in the whole program is a canonical `Str`
// local, and an aggregate would have shown "canonical-slot: 1" while hiding
// that I32 and U32 promoted nothing there.
//
// Requirements: plain synchronous function bodies (async / generator bodies
// route locals through the async-to-generator shared cells and are excluded),
// no closure capture of the candidate locals.

  // wrapping this in a `for` would take the fixture to zero without any
