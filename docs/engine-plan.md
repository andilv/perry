# Perry engine plan — status quo and what is left

**Goal (owner):** best performance, best RSS footprint, minimal binary size.

**Status:** a performance worklist, not an architecture source of truth. The
routing tracker #7294 is closed. Current collector architecture and operations
live in [`src/internals/garbage-collector.md`](src/internals/garbage-collector.md);
dated incident narrative and superseded sequencing live in
[`engine-plan-history.md`](engine-plan-history.md). Last audited for GC drift
**2026-08-11**. The status narrative below is retained as measured history:
the gc-ratchet is
repaired, re-pinned, and liveness-proven (#7609 — fail open per cell, fail
closed on the verdict; owner action: promote to required after its first green
`main` run); the element-shape invariant gained a real revocation matrix
(#7608) and its first consumer — the versioned loop clone, `keep[j].v` at
**node parity**, 3.15× (#7612); and promote-on-first-copy landed (#7613):
`json_pipeline` 500k copies the 268 MB cohort ONCE — wall −24.6% AND peak RSS
−21%, the first change to improve both goal axes at once. #7592 total:
**60.4 s → 3.86 s (~6× bun)**, `JSON.parse` (~742 ms) is the remaining tail.
The Layer-1 emitter migration is **finished at its stated terminal condition**
(#7615, slice 8): the raw rooting API is now `crate::rooting::temp_root`, a
PRIVATE module whose accessors carry `pub(in crate::rooting)`, so a lowering
cannot reach past the combinators — unreachable, not merely uncounted. 36
modules on the ledger; fourteen raw entry points deleted for want of a caller. The v0.5.1299 public-baseline sweep is
kept as the baseline measurement event; rows fixed since are annotated in place
rather than overwritten, because they were measured individually rather than in
a fresh sweep.

## Status quo

### 2026-08-07/08 in one table — what closed, what opened

Twenty-two merges, v0.5.1324 → v0.5.1345. The construction campaign's measured
levers are now **all worked or retired**, and the day's dominant discovery —
`json_pipeline` at 500k records, found by the first published baseline sweep in
five days — went **97.6× → ~8× bun** in four PRs:

| item | closed by | result |
|---|---|--:|
| survivor-promotion handoff livelock | #7594 | 57.2 s → 12.1 s |
| constant pacing bands (both generations) | #7596 | → 5.8 s; 4 cycles, none futile |
| `charCodeAt` through the dynamic-bitwise helper | #7601 | fnv1a 11.2× |
| statement-position `push` length computation | #7600 | 2.77× pure-push |
| array-push write barrier (parent-side gate) | #7602 | `push_cls` 1.33–1.38× |
| typed-shape install re-derivation | #7586 | `push_cls` 1.091× |
| **Map/Set subclass as raw header (SIGBUS)** | #7573 | memory safety |
| **Array subclass as raw header (SIGSEGV)** | #7603 | memory safety |
| inherited Array statics on a subclass | #7605 | `MyArr.from` works |
| iterator-helpers surface dead (class-id collision) | #7583 | whole TC39 surface |
| second class-id collision (JSX/rawJSON) + scanning gate | #7589 | gate in `lint` |
| `known_failures.json` suppression → ratchet | #7599 | 37 entries → 10 |
| public baseline unpublishable (2 independent causes) | #7593 | `check` exits 0 |

**The `declared type as layout proof` bug class now has a named fix pattern**
(#7573/#7603): brand-check on `GcHeader.obj_type` at the shared runtime
funnels, redirect subclass receivers onto the spec-generic engine, PLUS guards
at any codegen tier that never calls into the runtime — #7603 proved the
runtime funnel alone cannot stop the inline-store tiers. Remaining known member
of the family: none filed. Adjacent leftovers: `ArraySpeciesCreate` on
subclasses, static-method GET form, `instanceof` a subclass (#7575).

**Remaining top levers, in order:** the #7592 remainder (~8× bun: two-hop
promotion copies 268 MB twice — promote-on-first-copy design is on the issue
with the fixed-point trap named; and `JSON.parse` 742 ms); class-field-store
barriers (the half #7602 could not reach); #7480 repsel element-shape proofs;
Layer-3 ceiling list (#7615's sibling half — Layer 1 reached its terminal
condition in slice 8, so the remaining rooting work is runtime-side).

**Gate debt still open:** #7554 (gc-ratchet CI has measured nothing since
2026-08-05 — REPAIR THIS BEFORE the next GC-pacing change, which needs it),
#7502–#7507 (root-lowering suites partly vacuous), #7300 (flaky codegen tests),
#7604 (the stress schedule can arm without firing on compute-only benches), #7606 (two macOS
gc-rooting gap crashes, untriaged), #6847 reopened (zlib link on macOS).

### GC correctness — the four layers

*The shape, stated once: a GC-managed pointer exists somewhere the collector
does not know about, across a point where the collector can run. The pointer
has three homes, each needing its own mechanism.*

| Layer | Home | Mechanism | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **0** | *enabler* | in-process LLVM | ✅ shipped (#7301), default cargo feature (#7353) |
| **1** | `perry-codegen` lowering code | `Raw`/`Rooted` discipline | design **validated & corrected** (#7459 — the RFC's own constructor was `E0499`); combinator form proven on the real emitter (#7461); the raw-pointer-across-lowering bug shape **eliminated crate-wide** (#7453, #7462–#7465). **Migration COMPLETE at its terminal condition (#7615, slices 1-8)**: `expr/temp_root.rs` is now the private `crate::rooting::temp_root`, every accessor `pub(in crate::rooting)`, so the raw API is unreachable from a lowering rather than merely unnamed — asserted by a source-level test with its own sabotage arm. 36 modules on the ledger; fourteen raw entry points (the `StoreOperandGuard` and `RootedHandle` families, `lower_exprs_rooted`, `lower_operand_pair_rooted`, `temp_root_scope_*`, …) DELETED for want of a caller. ★ Read the ledger's own caveat: a listed module cannot make an ORDERING mistake, which is not the same as "every window in it has a decision" — that audit half is per-module reading and is what remains. **Measured limit, stated once: on the real emitter this does NOT make the bug fail to compile** — `FnCtx` has no interior mutability, so the borrow form is unbuildable on it; the combinator removes the bug from the path of least resistance and the ledger denies the escape hatch, and that is all |
| **2** | emitted code's liveness | statepoints | ✅ **the default**, target-aware (#7370): native roots where the runtime can walk frames, shadow stack elsewhere |
| **3** | `perry-runtime` hand-written Rust | `RuntimeHandleScope`, non-optional | per-module ceilings (#7457): **595 of 705 modules locked at zero**, 107 listed with ceilings, 999 sites, and the list can only shrink — a cleaned module cannot regress (#7458). `across_*` combinators are the prescribed form (#7455). **End state not reached:** the raw accessor is still reachable inside listed modules |

### Repsel stack (the unbox-by-default campaign)

Phases **1 / 2 / 3a (#6909) / 3b (#6911) / 4a (#6915 + #7421/#7425) / 4b
(#6919)** are all merged; #6904's 26× histogram is closed (#7485 deleted the
dead 4b prototype flag). Next gap:
**element-shape proofs through array reads** — `keep[j].v`, route decided in
**#7480**: both candidate routes share one prerequisite (a per-array
homogeneous-element-shape invariant, construction-maintained, self-healing
like 4a's dense bit), consumed first by the #5093 versioned-loop clone, then
by element `Ptr<Shape>`. Prerequisite and consumer both landed (#7496, #7612);
the consumer's growth-forwarding crash is #7660, and the consumer now resolves
**object-literal** element types too (#7669), which took #7480's own kernel
from 34.5× node to **parity — 12 ms against node's 12 and bun's 12**. What
remains is element `Ptr<Shape>` *outside* a loop, which needs the type
visibility `receiver_class_name` deliberately still does not have; see backlog
item 6 for the closing table, for why the named-class arm's node baseline is
not the literal arm's, and for why the element-class proof and the
accumulator's numeric proof are one lever rather than two.

### Object construction — the dominant cost (#7469 campaign)

**This is the top row of the backlog and the best-measured part of the engine.**
Symbolicated decomposition of `churn` on the pinned quiet host
(`PERRY_DEBUG_SYMBOLS=1`, 1500 leaf samples, best-of-3):

| variant | Perry | node | ratio |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| `churn` (full) | 2.72 s | 0.17 s | 16.0× |
| `churn_alloc` — object literal + push | 2.44 s | 0.14 s | 17.4× |
| **`push_cls` — `new Node(v,w)` + push** | **3.99 s** | 0.14 s | **28.5×** |
| `push_num` — numbers into array | 0.30 s | 0.11 s | 2.7× |
| `churn_read` — element reads only | 0.35 s | 0.08 s | 4.3× |

`push_num` at 2.7× shows the array machinery is fine; subtracting it puts
**~79% of `churn` in object construction**. Within construction, **~76% is GC
and feedback bookkeeping and 7.7% is the allocation itself**:

| group | share | ticket |
|---|--:|---|
| `gc::layout` side tables (`layout_forget_*` 14.5%, `layout_note_slot` 7.9%, `js_gc_init_typed_shape_layout` 7.7%, …) | **33.6%** | **#7510** (construction/death half of #5094) |
| `_tlv_get_addr` | 17.0% → 27.0% → **1.1%** | closed by **#7565** (it grew as a *share* while everything round it shrank) |
| write barriers | 16.1% | **#7511** — *correctness-first: a missed barrier is a use-after-free, not a slowdown* |
| typed-feedback guards | 9.2% | repsel 3b |
| array helpers | 6.2% | partly closed by #7501 |
| **the actual allocation** | **7.7%** | — |
| user code | 3.7% | — |

That table is the **v0.5.1299 decomposition and is now superseded** — three of
its rows are closed. Re-profiled on v0.5.1325 (#7578, two independent `sample`
runs of `push_cls`, leaf shares):

| item | then | **now** |
|---|--:|--:|
| **`gc::layout::typed_shape_layout_entry`** | — | **~25%** ← new top lever |
| **write barriers** (4 symbols) | 16.1% | **~25%** (#7511) |
| user code | 3.7% | ~21% |
| `_tlv_get_addr` | 27.0% | **1.0%** ✅ #7565 |
| `gc::layout_tables::layout_forget_object` | 14.5% | **1.7–2.9%** ✅ #7525/#7532 |

**Nothing regressed** — the two survivors grew as *shares* because the rows
around them collapsed. `_tlv_get_addr` and `layout_forget_object` are no longer
levers and should not be worked.

**The new top lever, `typed_shape_layout_entry` (~25%)**, is not the
`ValidateSlots` loop: `push_cls` takes the `js_gc_declare_typed_shape_layout`
path (confirmed in the emitted IR — one call to `declare`, zero to `init`), so
#7515/#7532 are working. It is the install itself, whose hit path
`layout.rs:1022` documents as reducing to "the two header bit-writes
`shape_install_shared` would have performed".

**Partly addressed by #7586** (v0.5.1332): `push_cls` **1.091×**, `churn_alloc`
1.075×, `churn` 1.042×, at **+0 bytes by construction** (no codegen crate is
touched, so emitted IR cannot change). `deeplist` pays 0.7–1.3%, reproducible —
pointer fields put it on the validating entry point. The cost was never the call
overhead: **~30 of the ~70 hit-path instructions re-derived compile-time
constants of the class**, because the FFI boundary makes them opaque — 12
normalising two `(pointer, length)` pairs into slices only ever compared as
integers, ~11 of `words_intersect` setup over two immutable globals, ~6
recomputing the slot kind.

### ⛔ Two remedies that look obvious and are wrong. Do not rebuild them.

An earlier revision of this section proposed inlining the hit path at the `new`
site, reasoning that every argument but the object pointer is a compile-time
constant and that this is the shape #7566 won 1.81× on. **Both halves of that
were tested in #7586 and both are wrong.**

1. **Outlining/inlining the frame is not the lever — it is a regression.** The
   prologue does look like #7566's shape (`sub sp, sp, #0x150`, six `stp` pairs
   — a 336-byte frame and twelve callee-saved spills per construction, sized by
   LLVM for a descriptor build that runs once per shape). Outlining it behind
   `#[cold] #[inline(never)]` cut the frame to 80 bytes and the spills to zero,
   and made things **slower**: `push_cls` 0.72 → 0.75 s, `churn_alloc`
   0.72 → 0.79 s. Those spills are cheap dual-issued stores off the critical
   path, and keeping six arguments live to forward to the outlined call costs
   more in register moves than the prologue saves. **This function is bound by
   instruction count, not frame size.**

2. **⛔ Having codegen OR `GC_OBJ_TYPED_LAYOUT_INTACT` into the inline `new`'s
   header word is a use-after-free factory.** It is seductive because it is
   genuinely free — `declare`-path classes must have an empty pointer mask, so
   since #7566 the inline `new` already writes its `GcHeader` as one i64
   constant, and OR-ing one more bit costs +0 instructions and +0 bytes.

   It breaks the unwritten invariant **"intact ⟹ a descriptor is reachable"**,
   which `layout_note_slot` silently depends on. On a contradicting store to an
   object that is intact but descriptor-less, the probe resolves `None`;
   `layout_set_typed_unknown` — the only thing that clears the intact bit — is
   reached **only from the `Some(verdict)` arm** (`gc/layout.rs:782–788`), so
   control falls through to the pointer-mask path and **the bit is never
   cleared**. The object is thereafter `SIDE_MASK` to the collector and *intact*
   to the class-field inline guard, which consults no map by design. The raw-store
   fast path then writes a double over a pointer slot with no barrier and no
   layout note, and the next collection walks it as a heap pointer.

   Note the comment at `layout.rs:742` says a `None` verdict "can only cost an
   extra fall-through, never mis-track a slot". That is true **only while the
   invariant holds** — it is a consequence of it, not an independent guarantee,
   and it reads like reassurance to anyone implementing this.

**A declared class is no longer slower than an object literal.** #7512 is
**closed**: `churn_alloc` and `push_cls` both measure 0.75 s. The cause was not
diffuse — **#7515** fixed it, and the root cause is worth carrying forward
because it generalises: the dead-field-init elision matched `Expr::PropertySet`,
which the compiler *synthesizes* for anon-shape literal constructors, while
every source-level `this.v = v` lowers to `Expr::PutValueSet`. **Nothing a user
can type produces `PropertySet`**, so the elision was structurally unreachable
for the declared class it was documented as covering. *An unreachable predicate
passes every soundness test there is* — #7486 was correct in everything it
asserted and did nothing on the case it named.

One row in #7578 is **unexplained and should not be acted on as written**:
`js_array_length` at 10–15%, against a single call site executing 20,000 times
in a 20,000,000-push workload. Two isolation attempts failed — varying array
size moved the workload into a different GC regime, and a `.length`-only
microbenchmark measured 1.00 ns/iter for both a 1,000- and a 10-element array,
which is an empty loop (the read is loop-invariant and was hoisted). Both dead
ends are recorded on the issue.

**Workstream A has landed (#7566, v0.5.1324): the inline bump allocator is back
at `new` sites inside loop bodies**, outlined everywhere else.

| bench | outlined | gated | ceiling (all-inline) |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| `churn_alloc` | 1.32 s | 0.73 s (**1.81x**) | 1.81x |
| `push_cls` | 1.30 s | 0.72 s (**1.81x**) | 1.78x |
| `churn` | 1.62 s | 1.04 s (**1.56x**) | 1.56x |
| `tree` | 8.97 s | 9.10 s (**0.986x**) | 1.05x |

It reaches the full unconditional-inline ceiling on the allocation-heavy shapes
at **+0 bytes for every site not in a loop** (verified by per-function IR
differential, not by assertion). `tree` pays **1.4%** — it allocates in loops so
it inlines, but its time is dominated by copying and promotion, so it takes the
bloat without the win. That is the honest cost of a static proxy.

**The measurement that justified the previous default had inverted, and nobody
had re-checked it.** The outlined form was made default on "−45 IR lines/site
AND ~17% faster"; the size half still holds (~268 bytes/site) but the speed half
is now **1.81x the wrong way**, because everything *around* the allocation got
cheaper (#7474, #7486, #7487, #7501, #7525, #7532, #7535, #7536, #7552) until
the surviving FFI call dominated what the inline bump's bloat costs. A default
chosen on a measurement is only as current as that measurement.

Recorded so it is not re-attempted: **Mach-O has no local-exec TLS model.**
Building the entire runtime with `-Ztls-model=local-exec` leaves the `blr`
through the TLV descriptor byte-identical (1.02x). Per-call cost is already at
the plain-global floor — only the *count* of resolutions can be reduced, which
is what inlining does and what #7565 did structurally.

**Two traps recorded here because they cost real time.** `PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0`
**cannot** bound barrier cost — it makes `churn_alloc` *slower* (2.44 → 5.21 s)
because it also switches the collector out of evacuating mode; the 16.1% is
profile-derived only. And a TS annotation is never a layout fact, so no
bookkeeping may be elided because a field is declared `number` — elision must
be by-construction (`expr_produces_non_pointer_bits_by_construction`), and
#7501 found that even a static layout *declaration* gets revoked at runtime, so
collector-facing metadata needs a live header test at the store.

### Performance backlog — full app-pattern sweep (v0.5.1299, pinned quiet mini)

AC power, CPU-quiet gate passed, node 22.23.1 / bun 1.3.14, 11 runs per cell.
**All twelve kernels, worst first** — this supersedes the earlier partial table,
which topped out at 6.27x and predated two kernels running at all:

| kernel | perry | bun | node | perry/bun | owner |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| **object_deep_clone** | 657.0 ms | 17.5 | 56.9 | **37.5x** | ✅ **fixed — see below** |
| **promise_all_chains** | 259.7 ms | 22.7 | 64.0 | **11.4x** | unowned |
| json_parse_1mb | 438.2 ms | 68.1 | 127.1 | 6.4x | unowned |
| batch | 127.8 ms | 26.5 | 74.8 | 4.8x | unowned |
| map_1m | 1233.7 ms | 256.5 | 320.1 | 4.8x | ✅ **fixed — see below** |
| string_template_interp | 106.9 ms | 41.6 | 100.6 | 2.6x | unowned |
| json_stringify_1mb | 97.3 ms | 38.5 | 95.1 | 2.5x | unowned |
| string_concat_csv | 51.3 ms | 27.1 | 82.3 | 1.9x | borderline |
| buffer_transcode | 58.2 ms | 43.9 | 85.8 | 1.3x | ok |
| string_split_map_join | 51.1 ms | 44.1 | 75.8 | 1.2x | ok |
| regex_replace | 56.4 ms | 49.8 | 98.0 | 1.1x | ok |
| **date_format_parse** | 36.0 ms | 44.8 | 116.3 | **0.80x** | **win** |

**`object_deep_clone` and `promise_all_chains` are new to this table because
they were CRASHING, not slow** — fixed by #7495 and #7516/#7529. Their
first-ever measurement made deep clone the worst cell by 3x over the next.

#### Landed since that sweep — the two worst rows are gone

The table above is a single measurement *event* (v0.5.1299, 11 runs per cell)
and is kept intact as the baseline. The rows below were re-measured
individually on the same pinned quiet mini as part of the fix that moved them,
so they are **not** interchangeable with a fresh sweep — the artifact still owes
one, tracked under the #7475 blocker further down.

| kernel | sweep | now | vs bun | vs node | landed |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|---|
| **object_deep_clone** | 657.0 ms | **40 ms** | 37.5x → **~2.3x** | 11.5x → **0.67x (win)** | #7540 (closes #7533) |
| **map_1m** | 1233.7 ms | **309.1 ms** | 4.8x → **1.40x** | 3.9x → **0.96x (win)** | #7561 |

Both were single structural defects rather than broad slowness, which is why
each moved by an order of magnitude instead of a few percent:

- **deep clone** — `[...arr]` on an ordinary dense array ran the full iterator
  protocol. 90.45% of the whole process sat in `array_from_spread_value`, and
  the identical copy spelled `Array.from(tags)` cost **66x less**. A 3-element
  spread was ~25 allocations against bun's one allocation and a 24-byte memcpy.
- **map_1m** — `for (const v of m.values())` was 512 ms of the kernel; as a
  delete-safe index walk over the flat entries it is **5 ms**. Perry already won
  lookup before the fix (76 ms vs node 115, bun 103).

**Read this section before picking up any row above.** Four times this campaign
a ticket was worked from a headline number that had already collapsed — #7510
(33.6% → 11%), `layout_forget_object` (14.5% → 3.0% → 1.7%), `layout_note_slot`
(7.5% → 0.03%, correctly closed with **no code at all**), and #7478 (a 2.3x scan
penalty that was 1.01x by the time anyone re-ran it). Re-measure the row before
profiling it.

#7478 adds a second failure mode to watch for: **a stale floor is as
misleading as a stale headline.** Its acceptance bar was "materially under the
1350 ms `idiomatic` row" — but `idiomatic` is a *measurement*, not a constant,
and it had moved to 938 ms. A bar quoted as a number silently becomes a bar
quoted against a different build. When acceptance is "beat arm X", re-measure
arm X in the same run, never carry its number forward.

### JSON polyglot legs — the tape's scan penalty is closed (#7478)

`roundtrip` is the crown jewel and `field_access` was the standing problem: at
the v0.5.1299 sweep the optimized configuration was 2.2x SLOWER than the
unoptimized one at 3.6x the RSS, with a sigma of 136 against every other row's
under 5.

| leg | perry optimized | perry idiomatic | bun | node | rust serde_json |
|---|--:|--:|--:|--:|--:|
| roundtrip | **192 ms** (82 MB) | 1307 ms | 216 | 379 | 178 |
| field_access | **2984 ms** (219 MB, sigma 136) | **1350 ms** (61 MB) | 218 | 380 | 183 |

**That inversion is closed** — #7483 (DirectParser float parity), #7499
(reparse-on-materialize), #7537 (early batch flip), #7539 (tape
side-allocation), with #7546 fixing the wrong-JSON defect the work surfaced.
Re-measured at **v0.5.1370** on the pinned quiet mini, 11 interleaved rounds,
every arm's checksum identical to node 26.5.1:

| phase | tape on, then → now | tape off, then → now |
|---|--:|--:|
| parse only | 210 → **160 ms** | 1220 → 1196 ms |
| parse + full scan | 3030 → **1233 ms** | 1287 → 1224 ms |
| parse + stringify | 254 → **171 ms** | 1756 → 1449 ms |
| field_access | 2981 → **1721 ms** | — → 1480 ms |

The issue's headline was that a full scan cost **2.3x the direct parser**
(3030 vs 1287). It is now **1.01x** (1233 vs 1224): the tape neither wins nor
loses a scan, which is the correct resting state for a structure whose whole
value is on the paths that skip materialization. `roundtrip` — the memcpy path
this must not regress — went the other way, 254 → 171 ms.

**The two remaining terms are now orthogonal, which is the real result.** The
issue documented an *interaction* (scan sigma 214.9 under gen-GC vs 8.8 under
mark-sweep for the identical tape). Measuring all four `PERRY_JSON_TAPE` x
`PERRY_GEN_GC` combinations, `field_access` decomposes additively:

| | tape on | tape off | tape term |
|---|--:|--:|--:|
| gen-GC | 1721 ms | 1480 ms | **+241** |
| mark-sweep | 1133 ms | 938 ms | **+195** |
| gen-GC term | **+588** | **+542** | |

The tape costs ~200 ms whichever collector runs, and the collector costs
~560 ms whether or not the tape exists. The ~200 ms *is* the tape build (parse
only is 160 ms) and is structural, exactly as #7537 recorded: the build is
purely additive whenever the whole tree ends up materialized anyway, and
nothing can predict scan-shaped access before the parse.

So `field_access`'s remaining ~560 ms is a **generational-collector** term that
the tape-off arm carries identically. It is not a tape-policy problem and does
not belong to #7478; it is the same collector behaviour the GC campaign is
already working, on a workload that happens to reach it through `JSON.parse`.

### Gates and blockers

- **#7475 is the sole blocker for the public benchmark artifact**: two
  app-pattern kernels fail only under the auto-optimize runtime archive
  (isolated to the feature-stripped `.a`, scale-dependent, pre-existing).
  Until the artifact regenerates, `lint`'s public-baseline check stays red
  and merges to `main` need admin bypass.
- ~~#7477 DirectParser float divergence~~ — **fixed** (#7483, single
  correctly-rounded division per Clinger; all three of `PERRY_JSON_TAPE=0`,
  `=1` and node produce the same checksum). #7478 is unblocked.
- ~~The statepoint lowering has no static root-dominance checker.~~ **Closed by
  #7663.** `gc-root-dominance-statepoints` reads the production statepoint
  rewrite and checks `gc.statepoint` `"gc-live"` bundles. The shadow and native
  arms remain separate contexts because they inspect different IR contracts.
- **Ratchet probe coverage gap**: all GC-ratchet probes run at the default
  nursery cap; a large-Eden arm would have caught both #7472 and the #7481
  residual.

## What is left, in order

1. **#7533 — `object_deep_clone` at 37.5x bun**, the worst cell in the public
   artifact by 3x and newly measurable (it used to crash). Profile FIRST; the
   issue carries an explicit A/B against `f06270d06` to settle whether today's
   rooting re-reads are material on a spread-heavy workload. If they are, the
   answer is hoisting them (#7487's pooled-alloca precedent), never removing
   them — they close real use-after-frees.
2. ~~**#7478 — the JSON tape's scan path**~~ — **closed, re-measured at
   v0.5.1370.** The headline (a full scan costs 2.3x the direct parser) is
   gone: 3030 → 1233 ms against the tape-off arm's 1224, i.e. **1.01x**, and
   `roundtrip` improved 254 → 171 ms rather than paying for it. The four-way
   `PERRY_JSON_TAPE` x `PERRY_GEN_GC` decomposition above is what closes it —
   the tape term (~200 ms, its own build) and the collector term (~560 ms) are
   now **additive and independent**, where the issue had documented them as an
   interaction. The residual on this benchmark is therefore the collector's,
   carried identically by the tape-off arm, and is tracked with the GC work
   rather than here.

   Worth recording as method: **this ticket's headline was stale in both
   directions.** The 2.3x had been fixed by four merges nobody had re-measured
   together, and its stated floor (the 1350 ms `idiomatic` row) had itself
   moved to 938 ms — so coding to the ticket would have chased a target that
   had already moved and declared failure against a bar that no longer existed.
   Two switches, measured one at a time, was the whole difference.
3. ~~**`_tlv_get_addr` — thread-local addressing**~~ — **measured out (#7565).**
   Re-measuring first is what decided the design: the 27.0% was real, but the
   ticket's "41 distinct call-graph sites, this is diffuse" was not — **seven
   functions carried 98% of it and every one resolved `tls_hot::HOT`**, two of
   them resolving nothing else. So the lever was the accessor, not the call
   graph. Publishing the address cache into a pthread TSD slot and reading it
   inline off `TPIDRRO_EL0` (how `pthread_getspecific` itself works; what
   mimalloc does here) took `_tlv_get_addr` to **1.1%** and bought
   `churn_alloc` **1.167x**, `churn` **1.175x**, `push_cls` **1.144x** on the
   pinned host, without touching a line of generated code — the ticket's
   "thread a context pointer through generated code" would have crossed every
   FFI boundary against 2994 `.with()` sites. What remains is
   `RuntimeHandleScope`, not the allocation path, so **the ceiling on further
   thread-local work here is ~1%**. #7469's other workstreams (codegen emitting
   the bump allocation inline; per-object footprint) are untouched.

   **#7510 is effectively closed.** All three items were measured out rather
   than argued away: item 1 shipped (#7535, install now 1x per 20M
   constructions), item 2 shipped (#7525), and **item 3 collapsed to 0.03%** —
   2 samples of 5,869, with codegen emitting *zero* `js_gc_note_slot_layout`
   sites for `churn_alloc` and a stub-it-entirely ceiling of 1.016x. The
   type-propagation work (#7550/#7552) plus declaration-at-allocation
   (#7501/#7532) removed the calls before anyone optimised them.

   **Three times this campaign a ticket's headline number was stale by the time
   it was worked** (#7510's 33.6% -> 11%, `layout_forget_object`'s 14.5% ->
   3.0% -> 1.7%, item 3's 7.5% -> 0.03%). Re-measure before scoping; a profile
   more than a few merges old sends people at the wrong thing.
4. **#7511 — write barriers (16.1%)**. Correctness-first: acceptance requires
   `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION=1` / `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_MARK=1` and the ratchet
   probes, because a wrong answer here corrupts memory rather than slowing it.
5. **#7502 — the shipped root lowering has no coverage**: nine mechanics have
   no native-roots assertion anywhere, six of them shapes
   `gc-rooting-invariant.md` records as having already shipped broken. Today's
   ~20 rooting bugs were all found by hand with `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE`
   because nothing else can find them. This is the structural fix.
6. ~~**Repsel — element `Ptr<Shape>` for object-literal element types**~~ —
   **closed.** The element-shape invariant landed (#7496), its versioned-loop
   consumer landed (#7612, matrix #7608, corpus #7619) and stopped SIGBUSing
   (#7660); the last piece of #7480 was that `element_class_name` resolved
   `Array(Named(C))` only, so #7480's own kernel (`keep: {v,w}[]`) never
   reached the clone at all. Re-measured on the pinned quiet host, 200k
   elements × 50 sweeps, 7 interleaved rounds, checksums equal across all four
   runtimes, `rustc`/`cargo` at zero and 94.6–94.9% idle throughout:

   | kernel | perry before | perry after | node | bun |
   |---|--:|--:|--:|--:|
   | `keep: {v,w}[]` — #7480's kernel | 408 ms | **12 ms** | 12 ms | 12 ms |
   | `keep: Node[]` — what #7612 covered | 13 ms | 13 ms | 56 ms | 12 ms |
   | region-local `{v,w}[]` (#7034 §3) | 15 ms | 14 ms | 12 ms | — |

   **34× on the object-literal arm, to parity with both engines**, and the
   named-class arm is unchanged. The recorded 93 ms / 6.2× in the issue was
   stale in the *optimistic* direction (the real figure was 34.5× node); its
   cost model was wrong too, and the correction is the load-bearing part:

   **The two levers are not separable, and that is a property of the design,
   not of this kernel.** #7480 recorded "no out-of-line guard calls, the cost
   is stacked inline diamonds"; the object-literal arm actually carried three
   calls per iteration, the third being `js_dynamic_string_or_number_add` —
   with no resolvable class the accumulator loses its numeric proof, so `+` is
   not an `fadd`. The plan called that "a second, separable lever". It is not
   one: the clone is admitted only if it is provably call-free
   (`LlBlock::contains_gc_unsafe_call`, which counts every non-`llvm.` call),
   so a fix that resolved the element class WITHOUT also restoring the numeric
   proof emits the clone, fails the call-free test, branches unconditionally to
   the slow arm, and buys exactly zero at a cost in code size. Anything gated
   on call-freeness has this shape: the enabling proof and the proof that makes
   the body cheap are the same admission test.

   **What was deliberately NOT taken: `receiver_class_name` is unchanged.**
   Widening it to type an `Object`-typed element read is the #6377 blast radius
   #7612 refused, and it is not needed — the resolver lives in the matcher, and
   the clone was made self-contained instead (its `ElementShapeLoopFact`
   carries the class name and packed slot index, and the field lowering,
   `is_numeric_expr` and the arithmetic-operand router all consult that fact).
   So `keep[j].v` OUTSIDE an element-shape loop is byte-for-byte what it was.
   The numeric claim inside the clone is stronger than the annotation it
   replaces: the residual per-element check already proves
   `GC_OBJ_TYPED_LAYOUT_INTACT`, i.e. that the slot holds a raw double.

   **What remains, and why it is a different ticket.** Route A proper — a
   `Ptr<Shape>` element representation that survives outside a loop — is still
   open for the parameter/global case. It needs the type-visibility change
   above, with its own gap-suite A/B, and it should be scoped against the fact
   that the region-local case is already covered: `collectors/ptr_shape_elements.rs`
   (#7034 §3, E1–E5) puts that row at 14–15 ms with no work from this change.
   Sequencing note carried from before: element reads are 13% of `churn`, so
   against the bookkeeping levers this stays an RSS/footprint play more than a
   time one — but the 34× above is the kernel, and it was real.

   Method note for the next person: the IR census that proves the clone is
   call-free had been **vacuous since #7612**. `fast_clone_slice` sliced from
   the first *substring* match of `for.element_shape_fast.cond`, which is the
   `br label %…` terminator of the fast preheader — four lines above the slow
   preheader — and every assertion made against the result is a negative
   (`!fast.contains(" call ")`). The slicer now finds the block DEFINITION and
   asserts the slice contains the cloned body and its element load, so it
   cannot pass on an empty subject again. Same family as #7024/#7025: the gate
   ran, its subject did not.

7. ~~**Layer 1** — migrate remaining lowerings onto the rooted-combinator
   API~~ — **done at the stated terminal condition** (#7615, eight slices).
   The condition was "`expr/temp_root.rs` going `pub(in crate::rooting)` — the
   raw accessor unreachable, not merely uncounted". As literally spelled it is
   not expressible in Rust (`pub(in path)` needs `path` to be an ANCESTOR of
   the item — E0742), so the file MOVED: it is `crate::rooting::temp_root`,
   declared `mod temp_root;` (private) with `pub(in crate::rooting)` on every
   accessor. Both belts, because either alone is one keyword from being undone.
   A raw call planted in a migrated module no longer compiles (E0603); that is
   the sabotage arm, and it is the difference between this and a ledger line.

   Two items keep `pub(crate)` and are re-exported, neither an accessor:
   `TempRootPool` (compile-time slot bookkeeping) and `expr_is_inert_primitive`
   (the purity predicate the loop back-edge poll shares). Fourteen raw entry
   points were DELETED rather than narrowed, per CLAUDE.md's kill-policy.

   ★ **What this does NOT claim.** The ledger's own caveat, drawn the hard way
   in slice 4: a listed module cannot make an ORDERING mistake against the raw
   API, because it no longer names it. A window with **no rooting decision at
   all** is invisible to that check, and the only instrument for it is reading
   the module. 36 modules are listed; the remaining audit is per-module reading
   and #7640 is where the deferred sites live.

   **Layer 3** — shrink the 107-module ceiling list toward empty; same end
   state, same reason. That is now the whole of the remaining rooting work.
8. **Statepoint-side static checker** — teach `gc_root_dominance_check.py` to
   read relocation bundles, closing the gap the #7452/#7460 repairs named.
9. ~~**RSS re-derivation under the statepoint default** (#7056)~~ — **done, and
   the answer is that the root lowering is not an RSS lever.** Re-derived at
   `7bde3de24` on the pinned quiet mini (95% idle, zero `rustc`/`cargo`
   throughout), 12 ratchet probes x 7 repeats x **3 interleaved rotations**,
   every probe byte-identical to the pinned Node oracle in all 72 probe-runs:

   | | statepoint (default) | shadow stack (`PERRY_RS4GC=0`) | ratio |
   |---|--:|--:|--:|
   | peak RSS, 12 probes | 544.2 MB | 545.1 MB | **1.002** |
   | retained heap after `gc()` | 114,594,904 B | 114,596,520 B | **1.000** |
   | wall | 4,808 ms | 4,894 ms | 1.018 |

   **104 of 108 deterministic cells are bit-identical between the two
   lowerings.** All four that move are on `10_store_receiver_across_alloc` and
   are ≤0.31% — the shadow stack keeps 7 more objects live at that collection
   point than the statepoint map does. Between-rotation spread: retention
   **0.000%**, peak RSS max 0.621% (median 0.000%), wall max 2.779%. The arms
   were shown to differ before they were compared, per probe, not per suite:
   `statepoint-example` + `addrspace(1)` roots present on 12/12 under the
   default and **0 of both** under `PERRY_RS4GC=0`, with `js_shadow_frame_enter`
   rising to match.

   So #7056's RSS numbers were not invalidated by #7370. What *did* invalidate
   parts of it is everything else that shipped since, and the re-derivation
   should be read for those:

   - **§9's recommendation shipped** (#7377): the 16 MB cap no longer hangs off
     `gc_moving_loop_polls_enabled()`, and the poll has been default-off since
     #7161. The five arms #7056 tabulates (`on`/`off`/`off_rt`/`on_cap128`/
     `off_scav`) no longer name anything that ships.
   - **The cap is still the whole footprint lever, and now measured on 12
     probes rather than 8**: at `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB=128`, peak RSS is
     **1.911x** and retained heap **2.475x** the shipped cap, for **0.947x** the
     wall — up to 5.005x peak RSS on `04_dead_after_deep_stack` and 6.350x
     retention on `07_array_grow_evacuate`. Identical to 0.6% under both root
     lowerings, so this is a pacing result and not a rooting one.
   - **§7's false-retention table is gone, not shrunk.** It recorded a
     4.6x–54.8x conservative-vs-precise band on probes 01–08. `classify` at
     `7bde3de24` reports **excess 0.00% and spread 0 on all twelve**, with no
     `manual_collect` scan site anywhere — #7657 removed the forced scan at
     `gc()` rather than the reading.
   - **§6's real finding survives intact**: a conservative scan does not
     degrade the copying minor, it **disables** it. Forcing
     `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=full` under statepoints takes
     `minor_cycles` to **0 on all twelve probes** (`copied + promoted` 0 on
     all twelve), costs 1.98x retained heap (0.70x–6.35x) and 1.46x peak RSS
     (0.93x–3.47x). Smaller than the +364%..+5371% #7056 recorded, same sign,
     same mechanism.

   Not re-derived, and stated rather than hidden: #7056's largest RSS numbers
   (§3–§5, 272 MB -> 421 MB) came from three server-shaped workloads it wrote
   and never landed, so there is nothing in the tree to re-run. The 12 probes
   are what replaced them.
10. ~~**Ratchet large-Eden probe arm** (#7481's lesson), plus the pending
   quiet-host re-pins (`wt-scavtenure` baseline)~~ — **both done.**

    `13_large_eden_survivors` pins the cadence the matrix had no coverage of,
    via a per-probe `// gc-ratchet-env:` declaration that `check` compares like
    a metric (delete the directive and every band is still satisfied, which is
    exactly why the arm itself has to be gated). Full rationale and the
    perturbations that turn it red: `benchmarks/gc_ratchet/README.md`.

    **The finding that shaped it is worth carrying forward.** A large Eden on a
    small retained set runs **zero copying minors** —
    `arena_growth_full_escalation_due` escalates every minor to a full
    mark-sweep once arena in-use clears its 32 MB floor and exceeds twice the
    post-full baseline, which a 64 MB Eden over a ~1 MB live set does every
    time. The first draft of the probe did precisely that and would have been
    pinned on a collector it never reached. So `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB`
    is not, on its own, a "larger Eden" knob: above ~32 MB it is a "no
    copying minor" knob unless the workload also holds a live set. Sizing the
    retained set to 262,144 objects buys 4 copying minors freeing 37/36/68/68 MB
    — 49.7 MB per minor, the first copying 532,482 objects in one cycle —
    against 14.6–16.6 MB per minor on eleven of the twelve default-cap probes
    and 21.8 MB on `12_large_live_set`, whose tenured-proportional cap term is
    the shipped path to a larger Eden and tops out around 22 MB here.

    **`wt-scavtenure` is subsumed, measured rather than assumed.** #7432 is
    merged, its worktree exists on neither host, and the baseline has been
    re-pinned five times since — most recently in full by #7657 at `59d522052`
    on the pinned host, which also closed #7652's mixed provenance. Running the
    quiet-host driver's `--check` at this PR's commit against that artifact:
    **every one of the 144 pinned cells `ok`**, the only failure being the new
    probe's absence from the baseline, which is the friction adding a probe is
    supposed to cost. There is no pending re-pin.

    ★ **One trap found the hard way, and it is worth the four lines.** An
    ad-hoc `measure --probes-dir <copy>` first reported
    `09_try_catch_roots.heap_used_bytes` **−17.98%** against the pin, which
    reads exactly like drift since `59d522052`. It is not drift: a probe
    compiled with a `package.json` in scope retains one more 1 MiB arena block
    at `gc()` than the same source compiled without one, and 09 sits on that
    block boundary. Reproduced three ways — repo dir 5,825,256; any of three
    `/tmp` directories 4,777,624; `/tmp` **plus a copied `package.json`**
    5,825,256 — each stable 3/3, and unmoved by Perry's known build
    non-determinism (two builds from the same directory differ byte-wise and
    report the identical number). The driver and CI always compile from the
    repo, so the gate is self-consistent; **a copied probes directory outside
    the repo is a different compilation and its absolute retention is not
    comparable to the artifact.** Ratios between arms measured in the same
    directory are unaffected, which is why item 9's 2x2 stands.

## Binding rules (distilled from incidents; provenance in the history doc)

- **Measure on a quiet host.** The sweep's own gate (≤25% CPU sustained for
  60 s, AC power) is the standard. A fix was once reverted because the host
  was at load 55 and its check matched an absent symbol.
- **The #6377 gate:** every "more type visibility" change un-gates latent
  broken fast paths its own microbench never exercises. Acceptance for any
  repsel/proof phase is the FULL gap suite against a same-session `main`
  baseline, byte-diffed against the pinned node oracle — never the phase's
  own microbench.
- **Stale-archive discipline:** `perry-runtime`/`perry-stdlib` are rlib-only —
  build the `-static` wrappers, verify the `.a` mtime moved, and set
  `PERRY_NO_AUTO_OPTIMIZE=1` for hand-rolled probes. The auto-optimize path
  builds its own feature-stripped runtime and links it OVER
  `PERRY_RUNTIME_DIR`, which silently voids A/B tests (and is itself the
  subject of #7475).
- **A gate must assert its subject was live**: zero root stores ⇒ refuse the
  verdict; count the corpus; sabotage-test new instruments (plant the bug,
  watch the gate go red). Four required gates were dead on `main` in one day
  for violations of exactly this.
- **Do not** re-measure GC pacing or update the README's performance table
  mid-cycle. GC env knobs follow CLAUDE.md's kill-policy.
- **`$?` after a pipe is the pipe's exit status, not the program's.** Capture
  exit codes without pipes; this produced both a false red and a false green
  in a single afternoon.
