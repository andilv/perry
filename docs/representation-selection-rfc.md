# RFC: Type-Driven Representation Selection — unbox-by-default for statically-typed values

**Status:** Draft / RFC, v2 (2026-07-27)
**Scope:** all value classes — scalars, strings, objects, typed arrays, closures — not only numeric code.
**Driving benchmark:** bcryptjs `_encipher` (real, unrolled) — must compile to unboxed native and beat V8.

## 1. Problem

Perry's canonical value representation is the **NaN-boxed `double`**. Native machine types
(`NativeRep::{I32,U32,F64,F32,I1,Ptr,…}`) exist, but they are **region-local overlays**: the
`NativeRep` doc comments say it — *"region-local," "optimizer-local," "Public ABI remains
`JsValue`,"* — and a whole `materialize_*_to_js_value` family re-boxes a native value at every
JS-visible boundary. Concretely, verified in emitted IR:

- A provably-i32 loop accumulator `l` is stored as `alloca double`; post-`-O3` it is a
  **`phi double`** carried across the loop back-edge, so **every iteration** does
  `fptosi double %l` (unbox, twice) and `sitofp i32 → double` (rebox). LLVM cannot remove them —
  the canonical representation is `double` and the `| 0` truncation isn't a provable no-op on a
  double. (Counts survive `-O3`: fptosi=3, sitofp=6, `phi double`=3 in a trivial 8-element mixer.)
- Function params are `double %argN` — the ABI is uniformly boxed. A hot function called millions
  of times receives its typed-array/number args boxed and re-unboxes them on every call.
- A typed-array *element* is raw i32 in memory, but the *access path* re-boxes the result to a
  double before the consumer sees it.
- Numeric locals are even registered as GC roots (`js_shadow_slot_bind`) though a number can never
  be a pointer — wasted root-set work.

**Consequence:** statically-typed code round-trips through the box on every op and every call.
This is why AOT Perry loses to V8's JIT on integer-heavy code (measured on a faithful, unrolled
bcryptjs `_encipher`: **834 ms vs Node 184 ms** for the same work), and why *expression-level*
fast paths don't compose — each is another overlay on a boxed canonical, and they invert on
unrolled code (adding types to the real `_encipher` *regressed* it 834 → 2732 ms, because ~80
per-read guards plus boundary re-materialization dominate). Optimizing individual expressions
cannot fix a representation problem.

## 2. Goal / non-goals

**Goal:** make the native (unboxed) representation the **canonical, first-class** representation of
any value whose type is statically proven — for **every value class where a sound unboxed form
exists** (scalars, strings, objects, typed arrays, closures) — confining NaN-boxing to values that
are provably polymorphic. End-to-end: locals, params, returns, and typed heap slots.

**Non-goals:** unboxing genuinely-polymorphic code (it stays boxed — NaN-boxing remains the
*default* representation, not the *only* one); building a JIT / deopt tier; changing observable
JavaScript semantics in any way.

## 3. Prior art (existence proof)

- **Static Hermes** (Meta) — an AOT compiler for JS/TS that uses static types to emit unboxed native
  code, with no NaN-box for typed values. This RFC is the same architecture applied to Perry.
- **V8 / JavaScriptCore / SpiderMonkey** — do representation selection *dynamically* (type feedback +
  deopt). Perry, being AOT with no deopt tier, must **prove** types statically (conservatively,
  falling back to `Boxed`) rather than speculate. That is AOT's job — and its advantage: no warmup,
  no deopt overhead, so a statically-proven kernel can *beat* the JIT, not merely match it.

## 4. Type-class coverage — what "all types" means concretely

The lattice covers every class; the *win profile* and *constraints* differ per class. Two facts of
Perry's runtime shape the table: (a) under NaN-boxing a **plain number is stored as its own double
bits** (tags live in NaN space), so a proven-`F64` value is already bit-identical unboxed — its win
is eliminating tag-*checks* and dynamic dispatch, not changing bits; (b) Perry's GC **moves objects**
(evacuation with root rewriting), so raw-pointer representations must remain registered, rewritable
roots — their win is *static dispatch and layout*, not root elimination.

| Class | Unboxed rep | Primary win | GC | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `I32`/`U32` | `i32` | kill f64↔i32 round-trips; native bitwise/index | not a root | value-range proof required (§4.7) |
| `F64` | `double` (same bits) | eliminate tag-checks + dynamic dispatch on use | not a root | IEEE-754 semantics untouched (§4.8) |
| `F32` | `float` | storage/SIMD only when source-proven (`Math.fround`, Float32Array) | not a root | never introduce precision loss (§4.8) |
| `Bool` | `i1` | branch directly; no TAG_TRUE/FALSE compare | not a root | |
| `String` | `StringHeader*` | skip untag/retag; **direct** string-helper calls (no `js_jsvalue_to_string` dispatch) | rooted + rewritten | short-string (inline payload) values stay by-value |
| `Object(shape S)` | `ObjHeader*` + static shape | **direct field offsets** (no hash lookup), **static method dispatch** | rooted + rewritten | the dominant win for real apps (property access ≫ arithmetic in web workloads); eligibility in §4.6 |
| `TypedArray(kind)` | header ptr (+ hoisted data ptr/len in region) | guard-free element access once kind is proven | rooted + rewritten | data-ptr hoisting invalidated at safepoints if backing can move/detach |
| `Array<number>` (`Ptr<NumArray>`) | `ArrayHeader*`; elements are raw f64 in place (the NaN-box of a number IS its double bits; `TAG_HOLE` marks holes) | Phase 4a.0-4a.2: inline guarded tiers — header-proof tests instead of out-of-line guard calls, zero runtime calls on the fast path. Phase 4a.3 (`collectors/ptr_numarray.rs`): fully guard-free element load/store under the collector proof at sites with a per-site in-bounds proof — no header tests, no bounds check, no barrier/note | rooted + rewritten | density lattice `Dense ⊒ HolesOK ⊒ Boxed` (§5.7); a hole-OBSERVING read needs the `TAG_HOLE→undefined` select (guard-free reads are therefore number-context only), hole-DEFAULT consumers (`\|\|0`, `??0`, `\|0`, `>>>0`, numeric `+`) admit the 2-instruction NaN-canonical form under the raw-f64-or-holes proof only; growth re-derives the base after any extend |
| `Closure/Function` | code ptr + env ptr | static call targets (extends existing `FuncRef`) | env rooted | |
| `SmallBigInt` | `i64` | native 64-bit arithmetic | not a root | overflow → boxed BigInt path, exists today |
| `Null/Undefined` | singleton tags | fold checks statically | — | |
| polymorphic / union / escaping-to-`Any` | **Boxed** | — | boxed rules | permanent, by design |

**Sequencing by payoff:** scalars fix the math/crypto class; **objects-with-static-shape is the
class that moves real applications** (gscmaster/Next.js hot paths are property access and string
handling, not bitwise math). The architecture is built once; each class is a lowering + inference
extension on the same lattice, ABI, and boundary rules.

## 5. Architecture

### 5.1 Representation lattice (a first-class IR property)
Every SSA value, local, param, and return — and, in Phase 4, every heap slot — carries a
representation: `Boxed(JsValue) ⊒ { I32, U32, F64, F32, Bool, Str, Ptr<Shape|TA-kind>, ClosureRef,
SmallBigInt, … }`. `Boxed` is top and always sound. This replaces "canonical = Boxed, native =
transient overlay" with "representation is a property of the value."

### 5.2 Static representation inference
Interprocedural flow analysis / abstract interpretation:
- **Seeds:** literals, `new Int32Array(...)`/`new C(...)` and friends, TypeScript annotations, and
  known builtin result types (`Math.*`, `.length`, typed-array element reads, string ops).
- **Propagate** through assignments, phis, calls (interprocedural summaries), and returns; **meet**
  at joins, unifying to `Boxed` on conflict.
- **Conservative:** anything unproven becomes `Boxed`. Soundness beats coverage — no deopt net.

**Soundness barriers (forced `Boxed` or explicit guards).** Dynamic-JavaScript constructs defeat
static proof and MUST demote affected values to `Boxed` (or interpose a checked guard):
property accessors (getters/setters) and `Proxy` on any object whose shape the value's proof
depends on; `eval` / `new Function` / `with` in scope; indirect or unresolved calls (a value passed
to an unknown callee escapes to `Boxed` at that edge); native/FFI boundaries (the existing
manifest-declared reps remain the contract); reflection (`Reflect.*`, `Object.defineProperty`,
`getOwnPropertyDescriptor`) against shape-proven objects; `delete` on a shape-proven object;
prototype mutation (`setPrototypeOf`, `__proto__` writes) reaching a proven shape; and exceptional
control flow (a value's representation at a `catch` join is the meet over all potentially-throwing
paths — in practice `Boxed` unless all throwing paths agree). The inference treats each of these as
a hard meet-to-`Boxed` edge; none of them may be "optimized through."

**Profitability is a second, separate question (#7128).** Everything above answers *may we
select this representation*. Nothing in it answers *should we*, and the two have different
failure modes: an unsound selection is a wrong answer, an unprofitable one is a slower answer
that no test can see. #7128 measured the consequence — after #7110 widened the i32 range proof
and #7121 removed the module-init exclusion, `benchmarks/suite/15_mandelbrot.ts` promoted three
provably-bounded loop counters, none of which is ever used as an integer, and paid **+14.87%
instructions retired** for them (invisible in wall time: the workload is FP-latency-bound).

For an i32-range value, `double` is a lossless and equal-cost representation of `+`, `-` and
comparison. `I32` only *buys* something where the consumer cannot take a double without a
conversion — array/typed-array indexing, bitwise operands, `Math.imul` — which is the same list
§5.3 already gives for where `I32` semantics are exact. It becomes a *cost* the moment any hot
consumer needs the double back. So selection carries one profitability term alongside the
soundness terms: a value written after its declaration, with no i32-consuming read anywhere and
at least one double-consuming read inside a loop, stays `Boxed`
(`collectors/repsel_benefit.rs`). The term only ever refuses, so every uncertainty resolves
toward "not a cost"; a missed refusal is the pre-existing behaviour.

The same shape exists for the other representations and is not yet modelled: #7128 found every
`__pshape` clone dead-stripped before the object (finding C) and `Ptr<NumArray>` emitting nothing
outside its own fixture (finding D). Both are "selected, and no byte changed" — the cheap end of
the same gap.

### 5.3 Representation-selected lowering & operation semantics
Locals and params get native slots per representation; loop phis are typed; ops stay native
end-to-end. **Operation semantics are representation-preserving — lowering may never change an
observable numeric result:**
- **JS number arithmetic is IEEE-754 double.** `+ - * /` on proven numbers lower to native `double`
  ops (bit-identical to today, minus the tag checks). An `I32`-rep value entering ordinary
  arithmetic **promotes to `F64`** (`sitofp`, exact for all i32) unless the operation itself is one
  whose JS semantics are integral:
- **`I32` ops are exact only where ECMAScript already defines integral semantics:** bitwise
  (`& | ^ << >> >>>` — ToInt32/ToUint32 wrapped by spec), `Math.imul`, integer-typed-array element
  load/store, and array indexing. Additive chains may stay in `I32` **only** under a value-range
  proof that no intermediate exceeds i32 (the existing `known_finite_magnitude_bits` composition);
  otherwise they promote to `F64`. Lowering must never introduce integer wrapping the source
  doesn't have.
- **`F32` is storage-only** unless the value is source-proven single-precision (`Math.fround`,
  `Float32Array` elements); computation widens to `double` first (`fpext`), matching JS. No
  double→float demotion is ever inferred.
- **Widening is free and always allowed** (`I32 → F64` exact; `Bool → I32` exact). Narrowing is
  never inferred — it exists only where the spec defines it (ToInt32 contexts) or a range proof
  makes it exact.

### 5.4 Specialized calling convention (bounded monomorphization)
Functions are specialized on the **representation tuple** of (params, return):
- A statically-monomorphic call site (`_encipher(lr, 0, P, S)` with `P = new Int32Array(...)`)
  calls a specialized entry taking raw args (`ptr`, `i32`, …); dispatch is chosen statically.
- **Specialization key** = the representation tuple. Entries are **cached/deduplicated per key** —
  all call sites proving the same tuple share one specialized body.
- **Budgets:** per-function specialization count cap (start: 2 — boxed + one dominant tuple) and a
  module-wide entry cap (`PERRY_SPECIALIZED_ABI_MAX`, default 64). When a budget is exceeded,
  additional call sites route to the **boxed entry** (always present, always correct).
  Cold/polymorphic callers never specialize. Anti-bloat is proven **empirically**: the
  `binary-size` CI job measures the COMPILER binary, not user output, so it cannot see
  monomorphization bloat — instead, a large real corpus is compiled with the flag on vs. off
  (`PERRY_SPECIALIZED_ABI=0`, object cache cleared between arms) and the emitted binaries must be
  within ~1% of each other.
- The boxed entry is the permanent fallback ABI; specialization is purely additive.

### 5.5 Boundary transitions
- **Box (materialize)** only when a native value flows into a `Boxed` context (polymorphic call,
  `Any` store, `console.log`): scalars re-tag (`sitofp`/`uitofp`/tag-or), pointers re-tag with
  their NaN-box tag. Cheap, local, explicit in IR.
- **Unbox (accept)** when a boxed value enters a proven-typed context, under an explicit
  **per-representation acceptance contract** — mismatches take a checked path (throw where the
  spec throws; route to the boxed generic path where the spec coerces), **never silent wrong-value
  coercion**:

| Target rep | Accepts | Everything else |
|---|---|---|
| `F64` | any number (bit-identical) | non-number → boxed path / TypeError per the consuming op's spec |
| `I32`/`U32` | number with exact integral value in range (checked); in a spec ToInt32/ToUint32 context: any number via NaN-safe `toint32_wrap` (never raw `fptosi` — poison on NaN) | non-number → the op's spec behavior via the boxed path |
| `F32` | number proven single-precision-exact | boxed path |
| `Bool` | TAG_TRUE/TAG_FALSE | boxed truthiness path |
| `Str` | STRING/SHORT_STRING tagged | boxed path |
| `Ptr<Shape>` | pointer whose class/shape matches the proof | boxed dynamic dispatch |

  NaN, ±Infinity, −0, fractional values, and out-of-range integers are all **rejected** by the
  integral contracts (they take the checked/boxed path) — exactness is the contract, coercion
  happens only where the spec places it.

### 5.6 GC under unboxed representations (moving collector)
Perry's generational GC **moves objects** (evacuation with reference rewriting), which dictates the
pointer-rep rules:
- **Unboxed scalars** (`I32/U32/F64/F32/Bool/SmallBigInt`) are not roots — their shadow-slot
  bindings are dropped (a structural root-set reduction).
- **Unboxed pointers** (`Str`, `Ptr<…>`, closure envs) remain **precise, rewritable roots**: the
  slot is registered exactly as boxed pointer slots are today, and evacuation rewrites it. The rep
  changes the *tag discipline*, not root discipline.
- **Specialized-ABI pointer params** must be safe across nested calls and exceptions: on entry the
  specialized body spills each raw pointer param to a registered shadow slot (same mechanism as
  today's param binding — it already survives rewriting); all uses reload after any safepoint
  (call, allocation, loop back-edge poll). Derived interior pointers (a hoisted typed-array data
  pointer) are **region-local between safepoints only** and are recomputed from the rewritten
  header pointer after any safepoint — never live across one. No pinning is required; this is the
  same rebase-after-safepoint contract the masked-window region code uses today.
- Unwinding runs the existing frame-pop path; registered slots die with the frame — no new
  exception machinery.

#### 5.6.1 Enforcement — the GC x representation matrix

Each representation above shipped its GC-safety argument in its own PR, verified once by hand at
merge time, while the collector changed underneath all of them (#6910 mark/rewrite root-word
parity, #6921 typed-shape layout on the ctor exit, #6892 minor-sweep finalization, #6655 operand
rooting). Nobody verified the cross-product. It is now a maintained gate rather than a set of
one-time arguments:

- **The matrix.** `scripts/gc_repsel_matrix.sh` runs the whole representation corpus against every
  GC arm — `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE`, `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION`, `PERRY_GEN_GC=0`,
  `PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0`, `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=off`, `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1`,
  their combinations, and *each representation flag OFF x evacuation* — byte-exact against the
  pinned Node oracle. Wired into the `gc-stress` CI job: a fast 4-arm subset gates every PR, the
  full arm list runs on push.
- **A NEW REPRESENTATION MUST REGISTER ITS GAP FILE** in `test-parity/gc_repsel_corpus.txt`. The
  script fails when a `test_gap_repsel_*` / `test_gap_specabi_*` file exists that is not registered.
  This is the GC-side counterpart of the single-decoder refactor #6910 established for mark/rewrite:
  adding a representation teaches all the paths at once, or CI says so.
- **Liveness is part of the result.** Setting a GC env var does not prove the GC did anything. The
  first automatic collection needs ~1M escaping allocations, so a small gap test performs *zero*
  collections and every GC arm against it is inert (#6942, #6946, #6950). The harness therefore
  asserts liveness from the collector's own `PERRY_GC_TRACE` / `PERRY_GC_DIAG` output and reports an
  output-matching cell under an inert arm as **UNVERIFIED**, never green.
  `test-files/test_gap_repsel_gc_stress.ts` is the corpus member built to be live: it holds each
  representation's local across escaping allocation churn heavy enough to reach the collector. A new
  representation should extend *that* file as well as adding its own, or its GC arms stay inert.
- **What the matrix cannot verify today.** No reachable configuration in an AOT-compiled program
  performs an *evacuating minor*: every automatic collection is a full mark-sweep taken under
  `ManualGcScanGuard::force_full_scan()`, which additionally pins raw locals conservatively (#6950,
  extending #6946 from the `gc()` path). The rebase-after-safepoint contract in the bullets above —
  the core GC claim of every pointer representation — is therefore still argued, not tested. #6942
  tracks making it testable; when that lands, the matrix's evacuating arms flip from UNVERIFIED to
  green with no change to the harness.

### 5.7 Typed heap (Phase 4)
Unboxed storage extends to heap slots where the *container's* shape is proven and stable:
- **Eligibility:** an object qualifies for unboxed field layout only if its shape is
  closed-world-proven — no dynamic keyed writes of unknown keys, no `delete`, no accessor or
  `Proxy` interposition on it, no reflection against it, no prototype mutation, and **no
  polymorphic alias** (every reference to it carries the same shape proof; a single escaping alias
  to `Boxed` context demotes the layout to boxed). Escape analysis makes this decision; the
  default remains today's boxed field storage.
- **Shape transitions:** adding a proven field transitions between static layouts at compile time;
  any *runtime* shape change reachable at all (only possible when analysis over-approximated
  reachability of a barrier) is prevented by the eligibility rules, not patched at runtime.
- **Observation equivalence:** `for…in`/`Object.keys` order, descriptor reads, and `JSON.stringify`
  must be indistinguishable from boxed layout; codegen materializes boxed views on demand at those
  (rare, already-slow) surfaces.
- **Barriers:** typed pointer fields keep the existing generational write-barrier; typed scalar
  fields need none (another structural win).
- Typed-array element reads stop re-boxing when the consumer is typed (the element is raw in
  memory today; only the access path boxes it).
- **Plain numeric arrays (`Ptr<NumArray>`, Phase 4a).** Phase 4a.0-4a.2 shipped the inline
  guarded tiers (per-access header-proof tests on the raw-f64 / raw-f64-or-holes bits
  instead of out-of-line guard calls; zero runtime calls on the fast path). Phase 4a.3
  (`collectors/ptr_numarray.rs`) ships the collector: a local `number[]` qualifies for
  fully guard-free element access under provenance + containment, exactly like
  `Ptr<Shape>` locals — single-`Let` provenance (`new Array(<static n>)` or the empty
  literal `[]`; the first-increment scope excludes non-empty literals, `.fill` chains, and
  param-sized allocations), every use a numeric-key element read, an element write whose
  value is numeric-by-construction, `.length`, a numeric `push`, or a bare `return`; and
  the module-wide §5.2 barrier kill extended with the array-specific barrier (any indexed
  write through a `.prototype` object — a polluted prototype changes what a HOLE read
  observes, and the guard-free read cannot consult the runtime pollution byte).
  Length-shrinking / reordering / hole-materializing mutators (`arr.length = n`, `pop`/
  `shift`/`splice`/`unshift`/`copyWithin`, `sort`/`reverse` — the latter arrive as
  disqualifying method calls) and `delete` (module-wide, via §5.2) all demote. The
  **stale-binding exemption** is part of eligibility: containment means no callee ever
  receives the array (the Phase 2 specialized-ABI caller-allocated growth pattern cannot
  occur), every in-function growth site writes the live head back to the local slot, and
  consumers re-derive the base from the (shadow-bound) slot per access. Eligibility
  carries a **density lattice** `Dense ⊒ HolesOK ⊒ Boxed`: `Dense` (empty-literal
  provenance; growth only through numeric pushes — no hole can exist) drops the hole
  handling entirely; `HolesOK` (`new Array(n)`) emits guard-free reads ONLY in ToNumber
  contexts, where the proof-gated 2-instruction canonical-NaN form is bit-exact
  (`TAG_HOLE` → quiet NaN ≡ `ToNumber(undefined)`); anything that can store a non-numeric
  value demotes to `Boxed` (stays on the guarded tiers). Guard-free stores additionally
  require a canonical-raw-f64 RHS and a per-site in-bounds proof (static index range vs
  the allocation length — permanent because length can only grow — or a bounded-loop
  fact). Hole-vs-undefined observability (`in`, `Object.keys`, `JSON.stringify`) is
  preserved structurally: those surfaces reference the local as a bare value and
  therefore disqualify it, and bare (non-ToNumber) element reads never lower guard-free.
- **Unboxed object fields: assessed and REJECTED (Phase 4b).** The "unboxed field layout"
  bullets at the top of this section were scoped down after recon, and the eligibility
  machinery they describe was deliberately *not* built. Three findings drove that:
  1. **`number` fields are already bit-unboxed.** NaN-boxing reserves only `0x7FF9..=0x7FFF`,
     so a number field slot already holds raw IEEE bits; `raw_f64_mask`
     (`gc/layout.rs::layout_raw_f64_bits`) is a *proof bit*, not a storage change. Phase 3b
     already deleted the read-side guard on proven receivers, so no unboxing win remains.
  2. **Raw string handles at rest would break SSO** — short strings live inline in the NaN
     box and would have to be heap-materialized just to be stored "unboxed" — and buy nothing.
  3. **Raw `i1`/`i32` slots would need a third mask *plus* a layout probe at ~25 direct
     slot-read sites** — `JSON.stringify`, `util.inspect`, `v8` IPC serde and descriptor reads
     among them. Those are hot paths, not the "rare, already-slow" surfaces the
     observation-equivalence bullet assumes, so the probe would cost more than the
     representation saves.

  What Phase 4b ships instead is the bookkeeping the existing boxed layout was paying
  needlessly:
  - **4b.1** — a class-field store on a `Ptr<Shape>`-proven receiver retires
    `js_gc_note_slot_layout` when the value is a **non-pointer by construction**, and
    `js_string_addref_if_heap_string` when the value provably **cannot be a heap string** (the
    strictly weaker condition, which is why the two are gated independently — an object or
    array literal retires the addref but keeps the note). The generational write barrier is
    untouched. The note elision is sound in every layout state the receiver can be in:
    `UNKNOWN` and `POINTER_FREE` short-circuit inside the note; an intact descriptor falls
    through the `pointer_mask` arm untouched; and under `SIDE_MASK` the note would only ever
    *clear* the slot's bit, so skipping it leaves a stale set bit over a non-pointer, which
    costs one extra visit and nothing else — `mark_field_into_worklist` re-validates every slot
    word, and the evacuation rewrite path routes through the same function.
    The addref elision is keyed on the **value expression, never the declared field type**:
    Perry does not validate declared types at runtime, so a `boolean`-declared field can
    legitimately receive a string through an `any`, and a wrong elision there silently corrupts
    an aliased string on the next in-place append.

    Two scope notes. **A pointer-valued store into a pointer-masked slot is deliberately not
    elided**, even though it is a no-op under an intact descriptor: `lower_new_impl` has an exit
    (the standalone-ctor-symbol branch where `call_local_constructor_symbol` yields `None`) that
    returns a freshly allocated instance *without* emitting `js_gc_init_typed_shape_layout`, and
    such an object sits at `POINTER_FREE` where the note is the only thing that ever sets the
    pointer-mask bit the collector reads. Closing that exit (#6921) is the prerequisite for the
    stronger elision. Likewise the **guarded (non-`Ptr<Shape>`) class-field store keeps both calls** — its
    receiver can be a runtime-constructed object that never had a descriptor installed.
  - **4b.2** — `runtime_store_jsvalue_slot` canonicalizes an INT32-boxed numeric store into a
    raw-f64-masked slot (the object twin of `canonicalize_array_numeric_store_bits`), instead
    of letting one FFI/native-supplied integer evict that object's typed descriptor
    permanently and one-way.

## 6. Phasing (one design; each phase sound on its own)

- **Phase 0** — Representation as a first-class IR property + inference skeleton; `Boxed` default
  everywhere → zero behavior change; scaffolding + tests.
- **Phase 1** — Canonical unboxed **scalar locals** (typed slots + typed loop phis; drop scalar
  shadow roots). In flight: `perf/repsel-p1-canonical-i32-locals` (I32/U32 first; F64 tag-check
  elision and Bool follow the same mechanism).
- **Phase 2** — Specialized **ABI / bounded monomorphization** (§5.4) for statically-typed call
  sites. Unblocks unrolled `_encipher` (raw-typed args; the per-access kind-guard is proven away).
- **Phase 3** — **Strings + pointer locals** (`Str`, `Ptr<Shape>`, `TypedArray`): rooted unboxed
  locals, static string-helper calls, static field offsets and method dispatch on shape-proven
  objects. This is the phase that moves real web workloads.
- **Phase 4** — **Typed heap** fields (§5.7) + typed-array-access unboxing to typed consumers.

## 7. Acceptance criteria (reproducible protocol)

**Benchmark protocol** (all perf claims): quiet dedicated arm64 machine (load < 3 — the project's
M1 test box), Perry built at the tested commit (`perry-dev` profile), `PERRY_NO_AUTO_OPTIMIZE=1`,
object cache cleared between env-flag arms (`rm -rf node_modules/.cache/perry` — env flags are
cache-keyed but arms must not share objects), **min-of-9** wall-clock runs, reported alongside the
machine's load average. Node oracle: the repo-pinned version (`.node-version`, currently 26.5.0),
default flags, same machine, same min-of-9. **Pass threshold "beats V8": Perry min-of-9 <
Node min-of-9 on the same inputs**, with the structural IR proof attached (see below) so the result
is not load-luck.

- **`_encipher` end-state test:** the real (unrolled, untyped-source) bcryptjs `_encipher`
  (extracted verbatim from bcryptjs@3.0.3, 2.1M-call harness, golden outputs
  `lr0=-1623241632 lr1=-1640632493`) compiles to unboxed native i32/f64 end-to-end — structural
  proof: the post-`opt -O3` function contains **zero** `js_dyn_index_get` / `js_dynamic_*` /
  `js_typed_array_*` calls and zero `fptosi`/`sitofp` in the Feistel body — and beats Node per the
  protocol above, byte-exact.
- **Loop-kernel test:** the minimal typed mixer (`slot.ts`) post-`-O3` hot loop is `phi i32` with
  **zero** `fptosi`/`sitofp`.
- **Exactness harness:** the existing byte-for-byte gap corpus (`test-files/test_gap_*.ts`, ~410
  programs, `./scripts/run_gap_tests.sh` against the pinned Node) plus the conformance-smoke
  shards — **zero new failures at every phase**. Polymorphic/dynamic programs must show unchanged
  representations (spot-checked via `--trace llvm`).

## 8. Risks

- **Soundness under no-deopt:** must prove, not speculate; conservative `Boxed` fallback; boundary
  acceptance contracts (§5.5) must throw/route, never coerce. The central correctness burden —
  §5.2's barrier list is the checklist.
- **Compile-time cost** of interprocedural inference (summaries, caching, on-demand analysis).
- **Code size** from monomorphization (bounded by §5.4 budgets; proven by the flag-on/off
  emitted-binary corpus measurement — the `binary-size` CI job only sees the compiler itself).
- **GC complexity:** pointer reps under a moving collector (§5.6) — the rebase-after-safepoint
  contract must be enforced mechanically (a lint/verifier pass over region-local derived pointers).
- **Scope:** Perry's single largest architectural line — HIR, type system, codegen, ABI, GC, object
  model. It replaces the incremental fast-path strategy with a permanent representation model.

## 9. Evidence appendix

Measured during the bcryptjs `_encipher` performance investigation (2026-07-27; protocol of §7):

- `l = phi double` post-`-O3` with per-iteration `fptosi`/`sitofp` that LLVM cannot remove; a
  representation-selected slot would be `phi i32` with zero conversions.
- Real `_encipher` — untyped source vs. hand-typed params, expression-fast-paths on vs. off:
  **834 / 2732 / 6103 ms** (Node 184 ms). Typing the real code *regressed* it: overlays do not
  cross the ABI, and per-read guards multiply on unrolled bodies.
- The expression-level fast paths that motivated this RFC (inline non-BigInt bitwise; inline
  checked-f64 typed-array-param reads; int-valued-local i32 promotion) are correct, byte-exact,
  and help *looped, statically-typed* kernels (3541 → 1005 ms on a typed reproduction), but were
  0% on real (untyped-param) bcryptjs and net-negative on unrolled code — the empirical case for a
  structural, rather than incremental, fix.
