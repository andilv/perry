Perry uses a per-thread, tracing generational collector. JavaScript values are
NaN-boxed, allocations carry an 8-byte `GcHeader`, and each runtime thread owns
a nursery plus an old-generation arena. The implementation is the
`crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/` and `crates/perry-runtime/src/arena/` module
trees; code generation's root lowering lives in
`crates/perry-codegen/src/codegen/` and `native_root_coverage/`.

## Collection paths

New GC-managed allocations normally enter 1 MiB nursery blocks
<!-- gc-fact: BLOCK_SIZE = 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/arena/block.rs -->.
A collection can take one of three paths:

1. **Copying minor.** At a precise safepoint, live young objects are copied,
   roots and heap slots are rewritten, and whole from-space blocks are reset.
   Survivors that have aged out are promoted into `OLD_ARENA`. This is the fast
   nursery path, and it has a whole-block variant described below.
2. **Non-moving minor/fallback.** When collection begins somewhere that cannot
   safely relocate every live reference, the nursery is marked and swept in
   place. Budgeted low-pause cycles also use a non-moving path. This is the path
   the flat `HAS_SURVIVED` → `TENURED` flag pair ages objects on.
3. **Full mark-sweep.** Major pacing, critical host pressure, explicit full
   work, or `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` trace both generations and reclaim dead old objects
   as well as nursery garbage.

`PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE` is on by default and lets nursery pressure route to the
direct minor. `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB` tunes its base high-water cap,
16 MiB by default
<!-- gc-fact: SCAVENGE_NURSERY_CAP_DEFAULT_MB = 16 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/policy.rs -->;
tenuring feedback may grow the effective cap by up to 4×
<!-- gc-fact: NURSERY_CAP_SCALE_MAX = 4 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tenuring.rs -->
on live-set-bound workloads, where a fixed cap would multiply the per-collection
fixed cost by an enormous collection count. Generated write barriers are also on
by default. Turning them off makes generational minors unsound, so the runtime
deliberately falls back to full mark-sweep.

Old-generation page defragmentation is implemented, including the mutable-root
rewrite contract that relocating an old page requires, but it is **opt-in**:
`select_old_page_defrag_pages` returns an empty selection unless
`PERRY_GC_OLD_DEFRAG=1`. It shipped on by default once and was reverted, because
no fragmentation workload in the corpus exercises it — turning it back on is
gated on a stress corpus existing, not on the contract. Nursery evacuation and
normal old-generation sweep are unaffected either way.

## Aging, promotion, and where an object is born

The copying minor's tenuring threshold is **adaptive, not fixed**: it is the
largest number of survivals `S` whose projected survivor occupancy still fits
the desired survivor size, clamped to a ceiling of 4
<!-- gc-fact: GC_COPY_PROMOTION_SURVIVALS = 4 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/layout.rs -->,
and it drops to 1 (promote on first copy) when a measured survival-rate lock
shows the aging round is filtering nothing. The loop is always on and has no env
knob; `crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tenuring.rs` is its definition and states the
feedback signal it uses.

**Whole-block in-place promotion.** When the previous cycle measured a
young-survival ratio at or above 95%
<!-- gc-fact: PROMOTE_SURVIVAL_THRESHOLD_PERMILLE = 950 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->,
the next copying minor relabels the young blocks as old-gen instead of
evacuating them object by object: nothing moves, so nothing in the heap or in
any address-keyed side table is rewritten. A promoting cycle still traces — that
is what keeps the next cycle's decision measured rather than assumed — except in
the fully-live regime at or above 99%
<!-- gc-fact: UNTRACED_PROMOTION_SURVIVAL_PERMILLE = 990 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->,
where the trace itself is skipped and every object on the block is registered as
live. Two budgets bound the retained garbage that costs: a running cap on
promoted dead bytes
<!-- gc-fact: PROMOTED_DEAD_BUDGET_BYTES = 32 * 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->
and an untraced-promotion floor
<!-- gc-fact: UNTRACED_PROMOTION_FLOOR_BYTES = 128 * 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/promote_in_place.rs -->
that forces a measuring cycle before the assumption can run away. A full
collection resets both. `PERRY_GC_PROMOTE_IN_PLACE=0` reverts to
object-by-object evacuation, and the knobs that exist to make objects *move*
(`PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE`, a resolved `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`) turn the path
off outright rather than silently stop exercising their own subject.
<!-- gc-symbol: in_place_promotion_leaves_the_object_at_its_address_in_old_gen in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/promote_in_place.rs -->
<!-- gc-symbol: promote_in_place_knob_parses_both_states in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/promote_in_place.rs -->

**Born-old thresholds are type-dependent.** A pointer-free allocation above
16 KiB
<!-- gc-fact: LARGE_OBJECT_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 16 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/types.rs -->
is born in old-gen; a pointer-bearing one stays nursery-resident until 128 KiB
<!-- gc-fact: LARGE_POINTER_BEARING_OBJECT_THRESHOLD_BYTES = 128 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/types.rs -->.
The split matters when reading a survival ratio: a flat threshold sends the
intermediate backing stores of a growing array straight to old-gen, so the
garbage they abandon never appears in the young generation at all.

## Roots, by target

One root-set analysis feeds two lowerings:

| target | shipped precise-root lowering |
|---|---|
| 64-bit AArch64/arm64 and x86-64, including x86-64 Windows | LLVM RS4GC statepoints plus Perry's compact native stack map |
| `arm64_32` watchOS, ARM64 Windows, and unsupported architectures | Perry shadow frames |

This is target-aware, not host-aware. `PERRY_RS4GC=0` selects the shadow
lowering for bisection; `PERRY_RS4GC=1` requests native roots and fails closed
if the target cannot emit/read them. `PERRY_SHADOW_STACK=0` disables only the
shadow lowering—native-root analysis remains enabled when native roots are the
selected backend.

Runtime-owned roots do not live in generated frames. Registered scanners visit
module globals, pending async work, caches, registries, and other side tables;
`scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py` keeps the inventory complete. Runtime
helpers keep temporary values in `RuntimeHandleScope`/`RuntimeHandle` and must
re-read a handle after a call that can collect.

The conservative native-stack scan is not part of the production default:
`Auto` resolves to `SkipDisabled`. `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=full` is an
explicit diagnostic/sensitivity arm. A full scan pins ambiguous roots and
therefore makes the copying minor ineligible; it is useful evidence, not a
second normal rooting backend.

## Barriers and weak references

Every old-to-young pointer publication must hit the remembered-set barrier.
Codegen emits barriers for generated heap stores and runtime helpers perform
the same bookkeeping for their own exact stores. A minor traces remembered old
parents instead of retracing all of old-gen.

WeakRef, WeakMap, WeakSet, and FinalizationRegistry targets are excluded from
the strong trace. Weak processing is **registry-scoped on every path**: the
copying minor visits registered weak holders and repairs forwarded addresses,
and full/fallback collection snapshots the holder registry and consumes a
bounded number of holders per step (`FullWeakProcessingState` in
`crates/perry-runtime/src/weakref.rs`), so the work is O(registered weak
holders) rather than O(arena) and a budgeted cycle can return to the mutator
between holders.
<!-- gc-symbol: full_atomic_finalize_slices_weak_holders_with_tiny_budget in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/cycle_state.rs -->

## Budgets, memory pressure, and released blocks

The collector derives a heap budget, in priority order, from
`PERRY_GC_HEAP_LIMIT` (MiB), Apple embedded available-memory APIs, container
limits, then half of physical RAM. Budgets below 1 GiB scale trigger ceilings,
reclaim thresholds, nursery deferral slack, and RSS pressure thresholds down;
desktop/server defaults remain unchanged.

Platform hosts call `js_gc_memory_pressure(level)`:

- warning (`1`) requests a prompt minor;
- critical (`2+`) requests a full collection so old-gen garbage and idle arena
  blocks can be reclaimed;
- if collection is unsafe, the request is made sticky and drains at the next
  precise safepoint/allocation check.

Released 1 MiB blocks first enter a **per-thread LIFO reuse pool under a
process-wide byte cap**. The reuse order is thread-local; the budget is not — a
single global reservation is what bounds N live agents to one allowance instead
of N of them. The cap is derived by `gc_block_pool_cap_with_budget` in
`crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/heap_budget.rs`: 64 MiB
<!-- gc-fact: BLOCK_POOL_CAP_DEFAULT_BYTES = 64 * 1024 * 1024 in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/heap_budget.rs -->
on an unconstrained desktop/server process, scaled to one eighth of a
device/container budget with a 1 MiB floor. Overflow is returned to the
allocator, thread exit drains that thread's pool, and a critical-pressure drain
request is sticky: it survives unsafe/deferred periods and empties the pool when
the owed full collection finishes its arena reclamation.
<!-- gc-symbol: block_pool_cap_is_process_wide_across_live_threads in crates/perry-runtime/src/arena/tests.rs -->
<!-- gc-symbol: deferred_critical_pressure_drains_after_the_owed_full_cycle in crates/perry-runtime/src/gc/tests/block_pool_pressure.rs -->
Reported heap usage (`js_arena_stats`,
`process.memoryUsage().heapUsed`) is an exact post-collection **live census**
plus incremental deltas, not a sum of block high-water offsets.

## Supported controls

These are the operational controls most useful outside collector development:

| knob | purpose |
|---|---|
| `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` | bisection fallback to full mark-sweep |
| `PERRY_WRITE_BARRIERS=0` | compile/runtime barrier bisection; also forces full mark-sweep |
| `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE=0` | disable direct nursery scavenging for pacing comparison |
| `PERRY_GC_PROMOTE_IN_PLACE=0` | revert whole-block promotion to object-by-object evacuation |
| `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB=N` | set the base nursery cap |
| `PERRY_GC_HEAP_LIMIT=N` | override the process heap budget in MiB |
| `PERRY_RS4GC=0` | select shadow roots on a native-root-capable target |
| `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=full` | diagnostic full native-stack scan; disables copying |
| `PERRY_GC_TRACE=1` | emit structured per-cycle trace records |
| `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1` | emit human-readable collector diagnostics |

Rooting stress uses `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`,
`PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE`, `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_ALLOC_KB`,
`PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE`, `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION`,
`PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE`, `PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE_DEPTH`,
`PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN`, and `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN_ABORT`. Their exact
contracts and non-vacuity requirements live in the
[rooting invariant](gc-rooting-invariant.md). Research/bisection controls such
as `PERRY_GC_INCREMENTAL`,
`PERRY_GC_MAJOR_PACING_FLOOR_MB`, `PERRY_GC_MAJOR_PACING_GROWTH`,
`PERRY_GC_MOVING_SAFEPOINT`, `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS`,
`PERRY_GC_SAFEPOINT_ONLY`, and `PERRY_STACKMAP_WALKER` are accepted but are not
additional supported collector modes.

`scripts/check_gc_env_knobs.py` derives the accepted names from live
runtime/codegen/compiler parsers and rejects a current document, executable
script, workflow, or translation catalog that names a deleted knob.
`scripts/check_gc_doc_claims.py` does the same job for the rest of this page:
every path it cites must exist, every number carries a `gc-fact` marker naming
the constant it came from, and the marker is compared against that constant.
Several behavioural claims above additionally carry a `gc-symbol` marker naming
the **test** that proves them — weak-holder slicing, the process-wide pool cap,
the sticky critical-pressure drain, and in-place promotion. Deleting or renaming
one of those tests fails `lint`, and changing the behaviour fails `cargo-test`;
neither can go quiet while this page keeps claiming the old thing.

## Validation and CI authority

As of 2026-08-11, branch protection requires `lint`, `cargo-test`, `parity`,
`compile-smoke`, `api-docs-drift`, `security-audit`, and
`conformance-smoke-complete`. The GC-specific coverage is split deliberately:

| check | where it runs | required status |
|---|---|---|
| root-holder custody, GC-knob drift, and this page's path/number claims | `test.yml` → `lint` | yes (`lint`) |
| runtime unit suite and `run_memory_stability_tests.sh` four-mode matrix | `test.yml` → `cargo-test` | yes (`cargo-test`) |
| emitted root dominance, including native statepoint IR | `gc-root-dominance.yml` | not currently branch-required |
| pinned collector counters/RSS/wall matrix | `gc-ratchet.yml` | not currently branch-required |
| thread-local mechanism/policy budget | `tls-budget.yml` | not currently branch-required |

Useful local preflight commands:

```bash
python3 scripts/check_gc_env_knobs.py --self-test
python3 scripts/check_gc_env_knobs.py
python3 scripts/check_gc_doc_claims.py --self-test
python3 scripts/check_gc_doc_claims.py
python3 scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py --self-test
python3 scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py
python3 scripts/gc_root_dominance_check.py --self-test
cargo test -p perry-runtime --lib
```

The dedicated performance/rooting workflows have broader compiler and host
requirements; their workflow files are the authority for exact commands and
relevance filters.
