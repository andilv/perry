# Compiler Flags

Complete reference for all Perry CLI flags.

## Global Flags

Available on all commands:

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--format text\|json` | Output format (default: `text`) |
| `-v, --verbose` | Increase verbosity (repeatable: `-v`, `-vv`, `-vvv`) |
| `-q, --quiet` | Suppress non-error output |
| `--no-color` | Disable ANSI color codes |

## Compilation Targets

Use `--target` to cross-compile:

| Target | Platform | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| *(none)* | Current platform | Default behavior |
| `ios-simulator` | iOS Simulator | ARM64 simulator binary |
| `ios` | iOS Device | ARM64 device binary |
| `visionos-simulator` | visionOS Simulator | Apple Vision Pro simulator build |
| `visionos` | visionOS Device | Apple Vision Pro device build |
| `android` | Android | ARM64 device build |
| `android-x86_64` | Android | x86_64 emulator/device build |
| `ios-widget` | iOS Widget | WidgetKit extension (requires `--app-bundle-id`) |
| `ios-widget-simulator` | iOS Widget (Sim) | Widget for simulator |
| `watchos-widget` | watchOS Complication | WidgetKit extension for Apple Watch |
| `watchos-widget-simulator` | watchOS Widget (Sim) | Widget for watchOS simulator |
| `android-widget` | Android Widget | Android App Widget (AppWidgetProvider) |
| `wearos-tile` | Wear OS Tile | Wear OS Tile (TileService) |
| `wasm` | WebAssembly | Self-contained HTML with WASM or raw `.wasm` binary |
| `web` | Web | Outputs HTML file with JS |
| `windows` | Windows | Win32/GDI executable (default Windows backend) |
| `windows-winui` | Windows (Fluent) | Opt-in WinUI 3 / Fluent backend (#4680). **Scaffold:** currently renders via Win32 while the XAML widget mapping lands incrementally; selects the `perry-ui-windows-winui` static library. Build that lib first: `cargo build --release -p perry-ui-windows-winui`. |
| `linux` | Linux | GTK4 executable |

## Output Types

Use `--output-type` to change what's produced:

| Type | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `executable` | Standalone binary (default) |
| `dylib` | Shared library (`.dylib`/`.so`) for [plugins](../plugins/overview.md) |

## Embedding Assets

Bake static files (an SPA `dist/`, images, JSON, fonts, …) into the standalone
executable so it runs with no external files on disk (#5731).

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--embed <pattern>` | Embed a file, directory, or `*`/`**` glob (relative to the project root). Repeatable. Merged with `perry.embed` (package.json) and `[compile] embed` (perry.toml). |

```bash
vite build
perry compile server.ts --embed "./dist/**" -o myapp
./myapp   # serves dist/ from memory — no dist/ folder needed
```

Embedded files are reachable at runtime three ways:

```ts
import { embeddedFiles, readEmbedded, isStandaloneExecutable } from "perry";
import { readFileSync } from "fs";

for (const f of embeddedFiles()) {
  // f.name (e.g. "dist/index.html"), f.size, f.type (MIME)
  app.get("/" + f.name, (_, reply) => reply.type(f.type).send(readEmbedded(f.name)));
}

// or via node:fs at the `$perryfs/<path>` virtual path:
const html = readFileSync("$perryfs/dist/index.html", "utf8");
```

`embeddedFiles()` is a function (not a bare value like Bun's `embeddedFiles`) so
that array methods dispatch on its result. `readEmbedded(path)` and `node:fs`
accept either the `$perryfs/<path>` virtual path or the embed-relative key.

> **Note**
> `node:fs` consults the embedded registry *before* disk, and a bare
> embed-relative key matches too — so `readFileSync("dist/index.html")` returns
> the **embedded** bytes even if a `dist/index.html` exists on disk next to the
> binary. Read a real on-disk file by absolute path, and use the explicit
> `$perryfs/<path>` form when you specifically mean the embedded copy.
>
> Embedding currently requires a Unix-like host toolchain (macOS/Linux); on a
> Windows host `--embed` errors out. Cross-target / Windows embedding is a
> tracked follow-up.

## Debug Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--print-hir` | Print HIR (intermediate representation) to stdout |
| `--trace <STAGES>` | Dump IR at one or more pipeline stages. Comma-separated: `hir` (post-transform HIR), `llvm` (per-module `.ll` into `.perry-trace/llvm/`), or `all` |
| `--focus <NAME>` | Restrict `--trace hir` to functions/methods/classes whose name contains `NAME`, suppressing import/export/init noise. Implies `--trace hir` if no stage is given |
| `--no-link` | Produce `.o` object file(s) only, skip linking. The objects are written to `-o` — verbatim for a single-module program, otherwise into `-o`'s directory under module-derived names, since one `-o` cannot name several files. With no `-o` they land in the current directory. Each path is printed as `Wrote object file: <path>` |
| `--no-codegen` | Skip the `package.json` `perry.codegen` build-time steps (also `PERRY_SKIP_CODEGEN=1`). See [Project Configuration](../getting-started/project-config.md) |
| `--keep-intermediates` | Keep `.o` and `.asm` intermediate files |
| `--opt-report[=json]` | Report which values Perry could **not** statically type, why, and whether you can fix it. Text by default; `--opt-report=json` emits a stable schema for tooling. Also settable via `PERRY_OPT_REPORT=1` |
| `--statepoint-report[=json]` | Report native-stack GC root pressure: calls with live roots, audited non-collecting calls omitted, relocations, plain-map fallbacks, and live-root widths. Research-only; requires `PERRY_RS4GC=1`, the one native-root backend (the plain stack-map and explicit-bridge modes it also named are gone) |

The `--trace`/`--focus` pair localizes "compiled to the wrong thing" bugs:
`perry compile foo.ts --trace hir,llvm --focus parseRow` dumps just the
`parseRow` function's lowered HIR and the module's LLVM IR, so you can see
which stage corrupted it without scrolling a full-module dump. `--trace llvm`
forces a full recompile (the object cache otherwise skips codegen for
unchanged modules, leaving the trace dir empty).

### `--opt-report` — why a value stayed boxed

Perry's speed comes from proving static types and selecting unboxed
representations (see the
[representation-selection RFC](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/blob/main/docs/representation-selection-rfc.md)).
When a proof fails the value stays NaN-boxed and the fast paths silently do
not fire. `--opt-report` is the representation-selection analogue of LLVM's
`-Rpass-missed` remarks: it prints what was proven, what was not, and which
rule made the call.

```console
$ perry compile batch.ts -o batch --opt-report
Representation summary
----------------------
  Ptr<Shape>          0 selected /    4 denied   (0% of 4 candidates)
  I32/U32/Str         3 selected /    0 denied   (100% of 3 candidates)
  specialized ABI     0 selected /    3 denied   (0% of 3 candidates)
  TOTAL            3 values unboxed, 7 left Boxed

*** Ptr<Shape> promoted 0 of 4 candidates in this build. ***
    Every candidate was denied; the rules are in collectors/ptr_shape.rs.
...
  batch.ts :: local `acc` [loop depth 0]
      in function totalsRow -> Boxed
      ptr-shape rule 2 (containment)
      returned from this function. Return positions do not carry a shape
      fact yet, so returning a record forfeits its proof.
```

Each denied value carries:

- **Position** — `local`, `param`, `return`, `field`, or `alloc-site` (an
  object literal that is never bound to a local, the `.map(x => ({...}))`
  idiom).
- **The rule that denied it**, in the collector's own numbering, so you can
  check it against the named source file.
- **An actionability tier**: *Fixable in your source* (stop reassigning it,
  don't capture it in a closure), *Inherently polymorphic* (correctly boxed —
  no action), or *Perry limitation* (not your code; names the tracking issue
  where one exists).
- **A hotness proxy.** Loop-nesting depth **and**, separately, whether the
  enclosing region is an iterating builtin's callback. The two are reported
  as distinct columns on purpose: a `map`/`sort`/`reduce` callback has no
  loop of its own but runs once per element, so loop depth alone ranks it
  last. Neither is a profile — they are static proxies.

Wins are reported alongside the misses, so the ratio is visible rather than
just the complaints.

**It is observational only** — emitted code is byte-identical with the flag
on and off. Like `--trace llvm`, it disables build and object cache reuse for
its own run, because a cache hit skips codegen entirely and there would be
nothing to report. The report goes to **stderr**, so it never mixes into a
`--format json` payload or your program's piped output.

Values are identified by **function and binding name**: Perry's HIR keeps
names through lowering but drops source positions, so there is no `file:line`
yet. `--opt-report=json` carries the same data under `schema_version: 1`;
diffing two builds' JSON is a cheap CI check against a representation
silently regressing to zero.

## Output Optimization

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--minify` | Minify and obfuscate output (auto-enabled for `--target web`) |
| `--march <CPU>` | CPU baseline for the generated machine code: an LLVM CPU name (`x86-64-v2`, `x86-64-v3`, `znver2`, `apple-m1`, …), `native` (tune to the build machine — the default for host builds), or `generic` (the target architecture's portable baseline — the default for cross builds). Pin this when the binary runs on other machines: a host-native build on an AVX-512 box otherwise SIGILLs on older x86-64 CPUs. Also settable via `PERRY_TARGET_CPU` or perry.toml `[build] march`; `[build] native_tuning = false` is shorthand for `generic`. Applies to app code and the auto-optimized runtime/stdlib rebuild. |

Minification strips comments, collapses whitespace, and mangles local variable/parameter/non-exported function names for smaller output.

### Size-optimized builds

For the smallest possible native binaries, two opt-in environment variables
rebuild the auto-optimized runtime/stdlib archives tuned for size instead of
speed (they require a Perry workspace checkout, like the rest of
auto-optimize):

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PERRY_SIZE_OPT=z` (or `s`) | Rebuild the runtime/stdlib at `-C opt-level=z`/`s` instead of `3`. Roughly halves a small program's binary at some runtime-speed cost (compute-heavy inner loops can run ~2-3× slower). Size-optimized and normal archives are cached independently. |
| `PERRY_SIZE_LTO=fat` | Additionally run whole-archive fat LTO over the rebuilt archives (slower rebuild, smaller binary). Only meaningful together with `PERRY_SIZE_OPT`. |
| `PERRY_SIZE_PANIC=abort-immediate` | Additionally rebuild the Rust standard library with the `immediate-abort` panic strategy when auto-optimize proves that no UI/thread/plugin callback needs unwinding, removing the backtrace symbolizer and unwind tables (~314 KB measured). Requires a nightly toolchain (`-Zbuild-std`); only meaningful together with `PERRY_SIZE_OPT`. A Rust-level internal panic then aborts without a symbolized backtrace — JS `throw`/`catch`, `finally`, error stacks and `uncaughtException` are unaffected. |

A `console.log` hello world on macOS arm64: 4.03 MB default → 2.17 MB with
`PERRY_SIZE_OPT=z PERRY_SIZE_LTO=fat` → 1.87 MB adding
`PERRY_SIZE_PANIC=abort-immediate`. Programs that use more of the runtime
shrink less, proportionally.

## Testing Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--enable-geisterhand` | Embed the [Geisterhand](../testing/geisterhand.md) HTTP server for programmatic UI testing (default port 7676) |
| `--geisterhand-port <PORT>` | Set a custom port for the Geisterhand server (implies `--enable-geisterhand`) |

## Runtime Flags

| Flag | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `--enable-js-runtime` | Enable V8 JavaScript runtime for unsupported npm packages |
| `--enable-wasm-runtime` | Force-link the wasmi WebAssembly host runtime (auto-detected when `WebAssembly.*` is referenced; needed only when loading via dlopen / FFI without a static reference) |
| `--type-check` | Enable type checking via tsgo IPC |
| `--strict-eval` | Fail the build if any runtime-unknown `eval(...)` / `new Function(<dynamic body>)` site is reachable. By default such a site is compiled to a deferred runtime error (throws only if reached) and a compile-time notice is printed. Also settable via `perry.eval = "error"` / `perry.strict = true` (package.json or perry.toml). `PERRY_ALLOW_EVAL=1` forces it off. See [Limitations](../language/limitations.md#no-eval-or-dynamic-code). |
| `--strict-dynamic-import` | Fail the build if a dynamic `import(...)` has a runtime-computed (non-resolvable) specifier. By default such a site is compiled to a rejected `Promise` that throws a descriptive `Error` only if reached, and is listed in the same end-of-build notice as deferred eval sites. Also settable via `perry.dynamicImport = "error"` / `perry.strict = true` (package.json or perry.toml). `PERRY_ALLOW_EVAL=1` forces it off. Resolvable forms (string literals, ternaries of resolvable arms, template literals over const locals, finite union-typed params, glob) are unaffected. See [Limitations](../language/limitations.md#no-eval-or-dynamic-code). |

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `PERRY_LICENSE_KEY` | Perry Hub license key for `perry publish` |
| `PERRY_APPLE_CERTIFICATE_PASSWORD` | Password for .p12 certificate |
| `PERRY_TARGET_CPU` | CPU baseline for generated machine code (same values as `--march`; the flag and perry.toml `[build] march` win over the env var) |
| `PERRY_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=1` | Disable automatic update checks |
| `PERRY_UPDATE_SERVER` | Custom update server URL |
| `CI=true` | Auto-skip update checks (set by most CI systems) |
| `RUST_LOG` | Debug logging level (`debug`, `info`, `trace`) |
| `PERRY_OPT_REPORT` | `1`/`text` or `json` — same as `--opt-report[=json]`, for driving the report from an environment where adding a flag is awkward |

The native-stack GC root-pressure report has **no** environment spelling: use
`--statepoint-report[=json]`. The `PERRY_STATEPOINT_REPORT` variable is set by
the driver to carry that flag to the codegen workers and is not read as user
input — it was a fifth GC env knob with no CI arm, and was deleted under
CLAUDE.md's GC knob kill policy.
