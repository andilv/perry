# `node:dgram` granular parity status

## Scope and oracle

This suite uses Node.js 26.5.0 as the exact oracle. The audit covers public
`node:dgram` behavior that can run with loopback addresses, ephemeral ports,
small payloads, and bounded event-loop turns. It does not use
`test-files/test_parity_*.ts`.

The fixtures adapt upstream contracts instead of copying the upstream harness.
Every network fixture closes its sockets and avoids Internet access, fixed
ports, host interfaces, real multicast traffic, and arbitrary sleeps.

## Pinned upstream evidence

- Node.js [`v26.5.0` / `bebd1b8d`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/tree/bebd1b8d92bf4cc917844d6335ed1ecf9c2a75fb):
  [`lib/dgram.js`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/bebd1b8d92bf4cc917844d6335ed1ecf9c2a75fb/lib/dgram.js),
  [`lib/internal/dgram.js`](https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/bebd1b8d92bf4cc917844d6335ed1ecf9c2a75fb/lib/internal/dgram.js),
  and 82 `test-dgram*` files under `test/parallel` and `test/sequential`.
- Deno [`34c46613`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/tree/34c46613cbe20450b74c0e8d4f0fd8f6f781d807):
  [`ext/node/polyfills/dgram.ts`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/34c46613cbe20450b74c0e8d4f0fd8f6f781d807/ext/node/polyfills/dgram.ts),
  [`tests/unit_node/dgram_test.ts`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/34c46613cbe20450b74c0e8d4f0fd8f6f781d807/tests/unit_node/dgram_test.ts),
  and [`tests/node_compat/config.jsonc`](https://github.com/denoland/deno/blob/34c46613cbe20450b74c0e8d4f0fd8f6f781d807/tests/node_compat/config.jsonc).
  The config enables 61 dgram tests and records eight more as platform-limited.
- Bun [`43d60f69`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/tree/43d60f69c95a9f31591165816ced29b83e94673e):
  79 copied `test-dgram*` files plus
  [`node-dgram.test.js`](https://github.com/oven-sh/bun/blob/43d60f69c95a9f31591165816ced29b83e94673e/test/js/node/dgram/node-dgram.test.js).
  Its copied corpus omits Node 26.5.0's `bindSync`, `connectSync`, default-literal
  lookup, and raw-handle tests.
- The audit checked Perry support in `crates/perry-runtime/src/dgram.rs` and
  `crates/perry-runtime/src/dgram/{net,ops,thunks}.rs`. Work owned by `net`,
  `dns`, `cluster`, `worker_threads`, and `async_hooks` remains outside this
  suite.

## Fixture map

`New` marks the 16 fixtures added by this audit. All source names refer to the
pinned Node 26.5.0 tree above.
`match`, `diff`, and `error` record direct output and exit-status comparisons
against that oracle. The pinned Deno polyfill/config and Bun copied corpus above
show whether each runtime also carries the upstream test family.

Nine existing fixtures add callback receiver data, block-list option validation,
and loopback-only lookup/error routing. Every fixture that creates a socket now
closes it from `finally`, and each fixture removes persistent listeners after
its contract settles. `multicast-membership.ts` now checks validation only; it no
longer joins a real multicast group.

## Repeated results

The expanded-suite totals were stable across three consecutive baseline runs on
2026-07-27. Perry ran without another process reading or rebuilding
`target/perry-auto-*`; shared cache work can invalidate a measurement. After
the runtime changes in this PR, a clean focused run on 2026-07-30 raised the
Perry result from 18 to 39 exact matches, with no compile failure, crash, or
timeout.

| Runtime | Version | Pass | Diff | Error | Compile/crash/timeout | Unstable |
| --- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Node oracle | 26.5.0 | 54 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Perry focused runner | current branch | 39 | 15 | 0 | 0 | 0 |
| Deno direct | 2.9.3 | 35 | 9 | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| Bun direct | 1.2.18 | 37 | 16 | 1 | 0 | 0 |

The Deno and Bun rows compare direct runtime output and exit status with the
same Node oracle output. Deno's 10 stable errors exit non-zero rather than print
Node's result. Bun's one stable error is the existing multicast-TTL `Infinity`
case. Neither runtime timed out.

Perry's 39 exact matches cover IPv4 and IPv6 loopback, bind overloads and
conflicts, connect ordering, buffer access, zero queue/ref state, core send
overloads, default hosts, sequential sends, implicit binding, socket controls,
socket-type validation, signal closure, async disposal, custom lookup,
constructor buffer options, block-list routing, range and scatter sends,
callback timing, address normalization, and send validation.

The 15 stable Perry differences that remain group into:

1. export/class/prototype/descriptors and receiver validation;
2. `bindSync()` / `connectSync()` and pending/already-bound state guards;
3. signal validation/closure and async disposal;
4. bind error metadata, failed-bind address state, close return/order/state,
   and default/custom lookup dispatch;
5. constructor buffer options, block-list options, and membership closed-state
   codes;
6. TTL `Infinity`, range slicing, empty/scatter arrays, array ownership,
   callback timing/receiver, and empty-address normalization;
7. address, buffer-bound, connected-send, advanced-option, and `sendto()`
   validation codes.

## Exclusions and stopping criterion

The final Node/Deno/Bun pass found no further contract that was both portable,
deterministic, in scope, and not already represented. The audit excludes:

- descriptor/handle binding, fd ownership, raw UDP handles, and kernel fault
  injection;
- `reusePort`, shared-port distribution, cluster, child processes, and
  `worker_threads` socket transfer;
- AsyncLocalStorage propagation and async provider IDs;
- Internet names, external DNS, non-loopback interfaces, fixed ports, and real
  multicast/broadcast delivery;
- interface-specific IPv6, link-local scope IDs, dual-stack port sharing, and
  source-specific multicast delivery;
- message-size/OOB/receive faults, resource pressure, signals, GC, and stress;
- close-during-lookup/bind races, recursive callback races, burst batch
  delivery, process-liveness timers, and ping-pong tests;
- queue-depth assertions that need Node's private `--test-udp-no-try-send`
  flag; the portable zero-state queue contract remains covered.

These boundaries assign DNS resolver behavior to `dns`, socket distribution to
`cluster`/`worker_threads`, stream semantics to `net`, and async context to
`async_hooks`.

The table and repeated direct-runtime totals come from this harness:

```python

            status = "error" if result.returncode else (
                "match" if value == oracle[path] else "diff"
            )
            if run == 1:
                first[path] = value
                print(name, path.relative_to(base), status, sep="\t")
            elif value != first[path]:
                status = "unstable"
            counts[status] += 1
        print(name, f"run={run}", counts, sep="\t")
```

```text

cargo fmt --all -- --check
./scripts/check_file_size.sh
python3 -m json.tool test-parity/node_suite_baseline.json
git diff --check
```

`cargo fmt` currently stops on unchanged `main` formatting in
`crates/perry/src/commands/compile/collect_modules.rs`. The file-size check also
stops on unchanged `crates/perry-runtime/src/object/mod.rs` (2039 lines) and
`crates/perry-stdlib/src/readline.rs` (2066 lines). `deno check` cannot resolve
the repository's matching `npm:@types/node` package from the local install;
`deno fmt --check` passes for every changed fixture.

Only the dgram floor changed in `test-parity/node_suite_baseline.json`, from
18/54 to the clean 39/54 measurement after the runtime parity fixes. Aggregate
metadata still describes the last full-suite run.
