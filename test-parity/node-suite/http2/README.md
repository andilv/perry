# `node:http2` granular parity suite

This suite contains 59 deterministic, single-contract fixtures. Network cases
use plaintext HTTP/2 on `127.0.0.1` with ephemeral ports and explicit event
barriers. Network fixtures close clients and servers in `finally`; the
sequential-cleanup regression resolves only after both close callbacks run.

## Pinned sources

- Node.js 26.5.0, commit `bebd1b8d92bf4cc917844d6335ed1ecf9c2a75fb`:
  `lib/http2.js`, `lib/internal/http2/{core,compat,util}.js`, and the HTTP/2
  tests under `test/parallel` and `test/sequential`.
- Deno commit `34c46613cbe20450b74c0e8d4f0fd8f6f781d807`:
  `ext/node/polyfills/http2.ts`, `http2_esm.ts`,
  `internal/http2/{core,compat,constants,util}.ts`, and
  `tests/unit_node/http2_test.ts`.
- Bun commit `44f6469e0d4ae93467aa65c7e3bc9001000c7b31`: `src/js/node/http2.ts`,
  `test/js/node/http2/node-http2.test.js`, and Bun's selected copies of Node's
  HTTP/2 tests.

The main Node contracts came from `test-http2-getpackedsettings.js`,
`test-http2-createserver-options.js`, `test-http2-invalidargtypes-errors.js`,
`test-http2-request-response-proto.js`, `test-http2-connect.js`,
`test-http2-client-destroy.js`, `test-http2-session-unref.js`,
`test-http2-ping.js`, `test-http2-update-settings.js`,
`test-http2-goaway-opaquedata.js`,
`test-http2-client-request-options-errors.js`,
`test-http2-misused-pseudoheaders.js`, `test-http2-sent-headers.js`,
`test-http2-multiplex.js`, and the compat request/response tests.

The suite replaces five broad fixtures and removes two secure-server fixtures.
The removed secure case used a fixed port, wrote fixed `/tmp` paths without
cleanup, and waited on a timer instead of a protocol event.

## Results

Node 26.5.0 ran all 59 fixtures three times with no failures or output changes.
Each run produced the same combined stdout digest:
`902c9e6a695d33df3653724f01459f346b6ed29929fed42f3fb8820db27b5747`.

Perry ran the focused suite with 57 fixtures three times. The two appended
fixtures and every fixture changed during review then ran in isolation three
times. All classifications stayed fixed, yielding:

```text
http2  32 pass / 59 total  (54.2%)  diff=27
```

There were no Node failures, compile failures, crashes, or timeouts. The
baseline is therefore `32/59` with no flake margin.

Deno matched Node on 54 of 59 fixtures. Its five stable differences are extra
module exports, default-settings key order, `maxHeaderSize` packing, alias
precedence/warnings, and unconditional unpacked-settings validation.

Bun matched Node on 35 of 59 fixtures. Its 24 stable differences group into
module/handshake surface, sensitive-header symbol identity, settings defaults
and packing/validation, pseudoheader validation, session state, GOAWAY stream
ID, and stream property defaults. All Deno and Bun cases exited cleanly; none
timed out.

Perry's 27 stable diffs group into:

- module keys, compat class identity, server inheritance, overload validation,
  connect validation, and the sensitive-header symbol;
- custom settings, `initialWindowSize` bounds, header aliases, unpacked
  validation, and default object shape;
- AbortSignal and request-option validation, live session class names, destroy
  semantics, and missing `origin`/`altsvc` methods;
- invalid pseudoheaders, multiplex order, `close()` validation, and
  `sentHeaders` before `respond()`.

## Per-fixture evidence

Each row names the primary Node 26.5.0 implementation or test used to select the
contract. Runtime columns compare exit code and stdout with Node.

## Exclusions and stopping rule

- TLS, ALPN, certificates, secure-session origin behavior, and HTTP/1 fallback
  belong to `tls`/`https` until those providers can act as a stable oracle.
- Internet tests, fixed ports, sleeps, scheduler races, large payloads, memory
  pressure, GC, signals, inspector, tracing, and kernel-specific failures are
  excluded.
- Socket ownership, backpressure, generic stream state, file-descriptor
  semantics, diagnostics channels, async context, workers, and performance hooks
  belong to their own suites.
- `respondWithFile` and `respondWithFD` stay out until they can test an HTTP/2
  result without turning the fixture into an `fs` test or leaving a pending
  response in Perry.
- Actual trailer and reset exchanges, pre-connect request queueing, ORIGIN, and
  ALTSVC stay out where Perry cannot yet reach a deterministic completion
  barrier. The suite already records their method surface or validation gap;
  another timeout would add no new evidence.
- Server push and extended CONNECT are not added: push is deprecated, and the
  remaining contracts either need TLS/backend work or duplicate request and
  stream validation already covered here.

The audit stopped after reviewing Node's implementation and full HTTP/2 test
inventory plus Deno's and Bun's current implementations and selected suites. No
remaining case was deterministic, local, HTTP/2-specific, non-redundant, and
able to exit cleanly on all four runtimes.
