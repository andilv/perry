// #9356 acceptance: drizzle-orm transactions over the native `mysql2`
// binding (perry-ext-mysql2), a few hundred in a row, with the young
// generation collected every couple of transactions (fixture.sh sets
// PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB=1). #9516 additionally keeps Drizzle's
// inferred `MySql2Database<TSchema> & { $client: ... }` intersection intact,
// so both `execute` and `transaction` exercise typed method dispatch.
//
// Before the fix the promise minted by `perry_ffi_promise_new` lived in the
// nursery; the first copying minor that landed while a query was in flight
// moved it under the worker thread's raw pointer, the worker then settled
// the retired copy, and the transaction never completed (~195 transactions
// with a 16 MB nursery, iteration 2 with a 1 MB one). Every query also
// leaked its native-async token, and the top-level `await` parked for the
// full 1 s idle budget after the drain had already settled its promise.
