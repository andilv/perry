// #11340: socket events for a socket opened on a `worker_threads` worker must
// be delivered on that worker. perry-ext-net kept ONE process-wide queue of
// pending socket events and woke the primary thread on every push, so the
// primary's pump raced the worker's for them: a worker's `'connect'` taken by
// the primary was dispatched against listeners on the worker's heap — dropped
// (the worker waited forever: compiled `pg` hung in `connect()` on a worker),
// run on the wrong thread (a `TypeError` after the worker exited, as mysql2
// showed), or a crash.
//
// The worker opens 25 sequential client sockets, in node-postgres' shape
// (construct, `connect()`, then `once('connect')`), to the harness's echo
// server (test-files/test_net_echo_server.py on 127.0.0.1:17891, the one
// test_net_min.ts uses). Before the fix the worker stalled within the 25
// rounds; the primary does nothing but wait.
