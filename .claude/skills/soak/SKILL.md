name: soak
description: Manages the repo's supply-chain soak window (SOAK_DAYS) — checks and fixes the derived surfaces, bumps or disables the window, adds dated per-package exclusions, and bumps pinned external tools. Use when a task touches minimumReleaseAge, min-release-age, min-publish-age, dependabot cooldown, external-tools.json, sfw shims, or taze cooldowns, or when investigating why a freshly published version won't install.

# The soak window

One rule: a release must be at least `SOAK_DAYS` old before this repo
adopts it. The delay gives the ecosystem time to catch a malicious or
yanked release before we ever install it. The window is defined exactly
once — read the current value from `scripts/soak/constants.mts` and never
hardcode it elsewhere. Every surface derives from or is parity-checked
against it:

| Surface | Key | Units |
|---|---|---|
| `.cargo/config.toml` | `global-min-publish-age` (nightly-only feature; inert on perry's stable toolchain) | `"N days"` |
| `tools/pnpm-workspace.yaml` | `minimumReleaseAge` | minutes |
| `.npmrc` | `min-release-age` | days |
| `tools/taze.config.mts` | `maturityPeriod` | imports `SOAK_DAYS` |
| `external-tools.json` | `soakBypass` annotations | days |
| `.github/dependabot.yml` | `cooldown.default-days` per update block | days |

## Commands (package.json scripts — the code lives in `scripts/soak/`)

- `npm run soak` — parity-check every surface (CI-gated: `soak-gate` job
  in security-audit.yml, always-run)
- `npm run soak:fix` — rewrite drifted windows, prune expired exclusions
- `npm run deps:update` — bump npm (taze) + cargo deps through the window
- `npm run tools:check` / `tools:fix` / `tools:install` — validate /
  prune-expired-bypasses / install the SRI-pinned external tools
  (`external-tools.json`); `tools:install` also writes the sfw firewall
  shims into the dev-tools bin dir
- `npm run test:scripts` — the scripts' own unit tests

The gates fail closed when a bypass window clears, but nobody has to
watch for that: the scheduled `soak-autofix` workflow runs `soak:fix` +
`tools:fix` daily and commits the pruning as a bot PR.

A soak change is done when `npm run soak` and `npm run test:scripts`
both exit 0 — the same gates CI runs. Re-run them after every fix.

## Change the window (one place)

1. Edit `SOAK_DAYS` in `scripts/soak/constants.mts`.
2. `npm run soak:fix` (rewrites cargo/npmrc/yaml and drifted dependabot
   values; taze follows by import). A dependabot block with NO cooldown
   at all is a check finding fixed by hand — add the two lines where the
   finding says.
3. `npm run soak` + `npm run test:scripts` — existing exclusion
   annotations encode the old window and will be flagged; re-date or
   remove them, then re-run until both pass.

**Opt out entirely**: set `SOAK_DAYS = 0` and run the same two steps —
cargo, pnpm, npm, and taze all treat zero as disabled. There is
deliberately no env-var bypass: opting out is a committed, reviewable
change, never a silent one.

## Skip the soak for ONE package (dated, temporary)

Add to `minimumReleaseAgeExclude` in `tools/pnpm-workspace.yaml` with the
annotation on the line above (block list only — flow `[..]` is rejected
because a comment line can't attach to an inline entry):

```yaml
# published: YYYY-MM-DD | removable: YYYY-MM-DD
- 'name@1.2.3'
```

`removable` = `published + SOAK_DAYS`; `published` must be the real
registry publish date (the placeholders above are schematic — copying
them verbatim is rejected). Once `removable` passes, `npm run soak`
warns until the pin is pruned (`soak:fix` or the soak-autofix workflow
does it). Bare names / `@scope/*` globs are standing trust and
need no annotation. External tools use the same shape via a `soakBypass`
object in `external-tools.json`.

## Maintaining this skill

`scripts/soak/` is the law; this file only documents it — when they
disagree, fix this file. When editing, follow Anthropic's guidance:

Keep it concise (goal + constraints, not step enumeration), keep the
description in third person with explicit "use when" triggers, and keep
the window value in `constants.mts` rather than restating it here.
