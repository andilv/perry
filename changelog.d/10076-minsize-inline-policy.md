Let LLVM choose ordinary shadow-root inlining under `-Oz` instead of forcing
every small-body candidate into its callers. Profitable inlines remain allowed;
normal optimization levels, `-Os`, native-root hints, explicit attributes, and
the separately admitted pre-statepoint inline path keep their existing behavior.

The shared definition-header renderer carries the policy into textual IR and
native LLVM construction. Independent header tests and a pinned-Node native
fixture cover both transports, both root modes, Os/Oz controls, exception and
object identity, callbacks, and actual moving collections. Scoped native CI
installs the repository's exact Node oracle and prepares the complete coherent
provider graph before entering the bounded fixture. Workflow-selection tests
prevent a second runtime build from consuming the native-test deadline.
