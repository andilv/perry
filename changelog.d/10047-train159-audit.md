Integrate native registration lifetime preparation, adaptive sorting and dynamic
operations, child-output EOF handling, own function-method dispatch, reused
generator capture cells, and cached JSON reads in Perry 0.5.1533. Retain the
revised sort benchmark's checked-in fixtures and raw samples. Add a shared-stream
listener witness requiring the relocated receiver and argument, and keep the
new packed property-get helper visible to moving-GC root-dominance checks with
stale/reloaded negative controls. Include the JSON cached-read regression in
the per-PR gap fixture selection.

Return the current array receiver after an allocating indexed setter, preserving
the caller's root across moving GC and growth. Cover both strict and legacy
setter entry points with an actual-relocation return-value regression.
