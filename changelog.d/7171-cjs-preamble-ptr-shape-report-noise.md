`--opt-report`'s `Ptr<Shape>` section stops charging Perry's own CommonJS
wrapper to the user's code. Over 195 real `__esModule` dependency modules from
`scriptc/node_modules`, **31 % of all `Ptr<Shape>` candidates (379 of 1231)
were two statements the `cjs_wrap` template emits itself** — and they were the
evidence behind two scheduling decisions that turned out to be about
scaffolding rather than about dependency code.

| denial bucket | base | after |
|---|---:|---:|
| rule 2 — bare reference | 140 | **4** |
| rule 1 — unbound alloc, constructor argument | 196 | **8** |
| rule 5 — module barrier | 187 | **132** |
| rule 1 — unbound alloc, all positions | 885 | **759** |
| total `ptr-shape` candidates | 1231 | **914** |
| selected / consumed | 3 / 11 | **3 / 11** |

Every removed denial is named: 136 of the 140 rule-2 bare references were the
local `__cjs_module`, as were 55 of the rule-5 denials, and 188 of the
constructor-argument allocations were the `{}` inside
`const __cjs_module = { exports: {} }` — 379 rows over 195 modules, almost
exactly two per module. Zero `__cjs_module` rows remain in any bucket. The net
drop is 317 rather than 379 because removing them **un-masks 62 real user
rows** (see below). Selections and consumptions are unchanged, which is the
point: nothing here promotes anything.

## The shape

`cjs_wrap`'s preamble emits, into every wrapped module:

```js
const __cjs_module = { exports: {} };
var module = __cjs_module;          // ← the rule-2 "bare reference"
…
require.main = module;
```

`__cjs_module` is a `Stmt::Let` of an object literal, so rule 1 seeds it as a
candidate; the next statement aliases it into a `var`, so rule 2 denies it.
The inner `{}` is an allocation in constructor-argument position, so rule 1
denies that too. Both fire once per CommonJS module, in every CommonJS module.

**The reference is not exemptable, and that is a finding, not a limitation.**
`module` is a reassignable `var` that the preamble goes on to store into
`require.main`, and that CommonJS bodies write `module.exports = X` through.
The record genuinely escapes; no narrowing of rule 2 could promote it. What is
wrong is that it was ever a *candidate* — promotion would buy nothing (a
one-field record, read three times at module-init, loop depth 0) and can never
be proven. So it is suppressed at the seed, not exempted at the rule.

## The recogniser (`collectors/cjs_scaffolding.rs`, extends #7139)

A region is a CommonJS preamble when its top level carries **R1** a
`mutable: false` `Let` named `__cjs_module` initialized by an `__AnonShape_…`
allocation, **R2** whose literal is exactly `{ exports: {} }`, **R3** uniquely
in the region, and **R4** aliased by a `mutable: true` `Let` named `module`
whose init is a bare `LocalGet` of it.

**R4 is the soundness argument, not a heuristic.** It *is* the denial: that
statement shape walks into `UseWalk`'s `LocalGet` arm under the default escape
context and disqualifies the record on every path, and `mutable: true` keeps
the alias pre-pass from tracking it. A region satisfying R4 cannot promote its
record, so removing it from the candidate set leaves the returned facts
bit-identical. R1-R3 only make the recognition unambiguous. Dropping a
candidate can only remove facts, never add one — the opposite direction from
#7139's barrier exemption, which relaxed a proof.

Recognised, the region also stops reporting the object literals of the four
preamble statements behind the record: the two `defineProperty` sites #7139
already recognises (same predicate, so the two exemptions cannot disagree about
what scaffolding is) plus `require.cache = {}` and `require.extensions = { … }`.
That half is report-only in the strongest sense — `unbound_new_sites` runs
only under `opt_report::enabled()`.

## Why the whole preamble and not just the record

`--opt-report` dedups allocation-site rows per function on
`(module, function, name, position, rule)`, and every object literal renders as
`object literal { ... }`. So each wrapped module contributes exactly **one**
alloc-site row, and which context it reports is whichever preamble literal the
walk reaches first. Suppressing only the record would have moved the row from
`constructor argument` to `statement` and changed the total by zero. The same
dedup is why `statement` rises 273 → 320 here: with the scaffolding row gone,
a *user* allocation that was being masked by it surfaces. Removing 317
scaffolding rows made 47 real ones visible.

## Evidence

- **Codegen-neutral, measured**: emitted LLVM IR compared base vs fix over 49
  dependency modules, each with a same-compiler control run — 47 identical, 0
  different, 2 excluded because their own control run differs (HashMap-ordered
  `perry_method_<Class>__<name>` emission when one method name is shared across
  classes; pre-existing, #7131 family). The one nondeterminism that IS
  normalised is HashMap-ordered `js_register_function_name` string constants,
  16 of ~12 900 lines; nothing else is. Object-file hashes are unusable here —
  the `--no-link` temp output path lands in the Mach-O debug records, so the
  same compiler run twice differs by ~2 KB.
- **Behaviour**: a CJS dependency fixture (`__esModule`, class, record,
  1000-iteration loop) compiled and run by both arms — byte-identical output,
  byte-exact against Node 26.5.1. Report on the same fixture: 5 candidates /
  2 denied → 3 candidates / 0 denied, with the *same three* selections.
- **Sabotage, 16 rows, each with a named red set**: every conjunct deleted or
  weakened in turn (R1 mutability / name / literal-ness, R2 arity / emptiness,
  R3 uniqueness, R4 presence / mutability / identity, the `require`-key
  whitelist, the candidate filter, the alloc-site skip) plus four template
  edits in `wrap.rs`. Control green in all 17 runs. The first pass had **four
  green holes**; all four were fixed in the code, not the tests — the binding
  name and the uniqueness count each had two enforcement points that masked one
  another, and the "is a record recognised" gate was a removable `if` that no
  test could kill. The record and its scaffolding bindings now live in one
  `Option<(u32, CjsScaffolding)>`, so "unrecognised but still suppressing" has
  no representation.
- **Template canary** (`cjs_wrap/preamble_canary_tests.rs`, extending #7139's):
  runs the real template through the real recogniser, with one anti-vacuity
  assertion per conjunct naming the conjunct it broke, and a negative control
  that a never-wrapped module recognises nothing.
- `cargo test -p perry-codegen --lib`: 472 passed (30 new). Census green, no
  floor moved.

## What this does not do

Nothing is promoted. Conversion to selected/consumed is **zero**, by
construction: every suppressed value was denied in the base arm too, which is
exactly what R4 asserts.

The dependency-JS wall stays where #7152 put it — rule 1, allocations never
bound to a local — but its size needs restating. In this corpus rule 1 goes
885 → 759: 188 base rows were the `{ exports: {} }` literal and 62 previously
masked user rows appeared. #7152's corpus is a different 180-module sample, so
its `506` is not directly comparable; by the same per-module rate, on the order
of 180 of those 506 are the same scaffolding literal, and the residual user
rule-1 population there is smaller than 506 but larger than `506 − 180`. Anyone
re-running that measurement should re-derive it against this compiler rather
than subtracting.

`gc_repsel_matrix.sh --arms all --pressure 8` was started and aborted during its
compile phase: a sibling agent was running the identical 21-arm matrix
concurrently and host free disk had fallen below the campaign floor. For a
change that emits identical code the IR comparison above is the stronger
statement, but the matrix columns are unmeasured and are recorded as such.

Both arms of the table are pinned at `df7214b0d`, differing only by this patch.
A re-measurement on the rebased HEAD keeps the scaffolding result exactly (rule-2
bare reference 4, zero `__cjs_module` rows) but moves the other buckets, because
an unrelated `main` change made `rollup/dist/shared/index.js` compile where it
had failed in both original arms. Different baseline, not a different result.
