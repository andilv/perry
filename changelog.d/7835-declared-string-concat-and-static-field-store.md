### perf(codegen, runtime): a declared `string` is enough to pick the concat lowering, and a `static` counter stops re-interning its own key

Three changes to the same theme — Perry re-deriving at runtime facts it already had at compile time — plus the runtime guarantee that makes the first one safe.

Measured on the quiet M1 mini, best-of-5, against a clean build of `1ee158d27` (perry 0.5.1463). Both arms built with `-p perry -p perry-runtime-static -p perry-stdlib-static`; every corpus program's output verified byte-identical to `node --experimental-strip-types` (Node 26.5.1) with exit 0 before timing.

The six `*_real` globalThis-bootstrap arms stay within ±2% of their base arms, as they were.

#### 1. `js_string_concat_box` delegates a non-string operand instead of dropping it

It decoded both operands with `str_bytes_from_jsvalue(...).unwrap_or((null, 0))` — so an operand that was not a string became the **empty string**. `"ab" + 42` through this helper rendered as `"ab"`.

**This is reachable on `1ee158d27` today — see #7837.** `is_definitely_string_expr`'s `LocalGet` arm already trusts a declared type, so a `string`-declared local holding a non-string selects this helper:

```ts
const t: string = (99 as any);
console.log(t + "x");   // node: "99x"   perry before: "x"   <- the 99 is dropped
```

Measured on a clean `1ee158d27` build and on this branch; a `string`-declared *field* (`o.t + 7`) and a `(string, number)` parameter pair both route elsewhere and were already correct, which is why the defect survived casual probing.

It was also the reason the concat fast path could never be selected from a type annotation in the first place: `lower_string_concat.rs`'s self-append lowering carries a whole `dother`/`cold` arm whose comment says, in as many words, that a lie has to be routed around this helper. It now forwards any non-string pair to `js_dynamic_string_or_number_add`, which is the full spec `+`. String+string is unchanged (including the ≤5-byte SSO result encoding); string+number concatenates with the number's decimal form; number+number **adds and returns a number**.

#7837 records a **second, separate** defect of the same premise that this PR does **not** fix: `s + 7` on a `string`-declared local holding `42` prints `427` instead of `49`, because the one-sided `l ^ r` arm picks the *operator* from the annotation. That arm lowers through `js_string_concat_value`, which takes an already-unboxed `StringHeader*` and cannot detect the lie, so it needs the guarded-diamond treatment #7831 is giving the numeric side — not this PR's runtime delegation. Deciding it is deliberately left to #7837.

#### 2. `+` accepts a declared `string`, but only where (1) makes that free

`"shape:" + this.tag` — a string literal plus a field declared `string` — lowered to `js_dynamic_string_or_number_add`: a `RuntimeHandleScope`, four `root_nanbox_f64`s and two `ToPrimitive` calls, spent rediscovering what the declaration already stated. `is_string_expr` has trusted that same declaration for string *method* dispatch since #655; the concat path did not.

The new predicate is `is_declared_string_expr`, and it is deliberately **separate** from `is_definitely_string_expr` rather than an extension of it. Perry does not enforce annotations at runtime — the exact gap #7831 is closing on the numeric side — so a declaration is evidence, not proof. It therefore has exactly one consumer: the two-operand concat, which emits `js_string_concat_box`. After (1) that helper produces the dynamic-path answer for every combination of runtime values, so **the declaration selects a lowering and can never select an answer.**

Three neighbours deliberately keep the strict predicate, each because it *would* be able to change an answer:
- the one-sided `l ^ r` arm lowers through `js_string_concat_value` / `js_value_concat_string`, which take an already-unboxed `StringHeader*` and cannot tell a lie from a string;
- the N-way chain fold formats every part as a string, so an all-declared chain of numbers would concatenate where the spec adds;
- the `Map` string-key fast paths in `expr::math_simple` key a lookup on the claim.

#### 3. `type X = { … }` resolves its property types, like `interface X { … }` already did

`lower_type_alias_decl` files aliases in `module.type_aliases` while `lower_interface_decl` files interfaces in `module.interfaces`, and `static_type_of` only ever consulted the latter. An object-type alias is structurally interchangeable with an interface in TypeScript — same declaration, same runtime layout, same absence of any layout guarantee — and `type` is the form most application code reaches for. So `type Record = { kind: string; … }` proved **nothing** about `r.kind`, purely because the author wrote `type` instead of `interface`. Only a non-generic alias whose right-hand side is a closed object type answers; an alias to a `Named`/`Generic` type is left alone.

This is what makes `pipeline.ts`'s `makeTagger` (`prefix + r.kind`, 360,000 calls) reach the concat at all.

#### 4. `class_dynamic_prop_root_store` stops allocating a key it already has

Codegen emits `js_class_register_static_field` after every `Expr::StaticFieldSet`, so `Shape.made = Shape.made + 1` inside a constructor runs it **once per construction** — 144,000 times in `shapes.ts`. Each call did `str::from_utf8(…).to_string()` (a heap allocation, immediately dropped, because `HashMap::insert` keeps the *original* key), a `CLASS_DELETED_KEYS` probe, and an `entry().or_insert_with().insert()`.

The signature is now `&str` — every caller already had a borrowed value — and a store whose key exists updates the slot in place. The in-place arm also skips the deleted-keys probe, but only while **nothing has ever been deleted**; once anything has, the original sequence runs verbatim, so the pre-existing conflation between a deleted prototype key and a same-named static field (`class C { m() {} static m = 1 }`, both under one class_id) keeps whatever behaviour it had.

#### Tests

- `perry-runtime`: `concat_box_delegates_a_non_string_operand_to_the_dynamic_add` pins all four operand combinations plus the SSO result encoding; `repeated_store_updates_in_place_and_stays_readable` and `store_after_delete_clears_the_deleted_mark` pin both arms of the static-field store.
- `perry-codegen`: `alias_declared_string_field_takes_the_static_concat`, `field_absent_from_the_alias_keeps_the_dynamic_add`, and `alias_declared_number_field_is_deliberately_not_routed` — the last one asserts the numeric side is *unchanged*, so a future widening there has to be a deliberate edit to this test.

All in-crate unit tests, so they run in the per-PR `cargo-test` job rather than the nightly-only integration suites (#5960).

#### Probes

`gc-handoff/bench/concat_field.ts` and `concat_field_base.ts` are the ns/concat pair: identical programs, 2,000,000 `"shape:" + this.tag` concatenations, differing only in whether `describe()` concatenates or returns a same-length constant.
