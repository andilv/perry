Make dense `Array.splice()` and `Array.unshift()` update GC element metadata
from only the inserted slots instead of rebuilding it from every live element.
Pointer-free and all-pointer layouts remain exact, mixed layouts fall back to
conservative scanning, and old-array dirty-page coverage follows moved
survivors. Splice and variadic-unshift inputs are rooted across allocating
steps. Repeated middle splice and front insertion no longer time out at 100,000
operations.
