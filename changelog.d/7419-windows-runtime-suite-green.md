**fix(runtime): the full `perry-runtime --lib` suite is green on Windows — SEH-safe longjmp, setjmp alignment, and four platform-shape test fixes (#7356)**

#7355 made perry-runtime *compile* on Windows; running the suite then surfaced the pre-existing failures inventoried in #7356. This lands the fixes and the CI arm that keeps them fixed. `cargo test -p perry-runtime --lib -- --test-threads=1` on Windows 11: **1635 passed, 0 failed** (previously: three process-killing stoppers truncated every run).

Two of the fixes are production bugs, not test bugs:

- **`js_throw`'s `longjmp` was undefined behavior on windows-msvc** (`exception.rs`). MSVC's `longjmp` reads `_JUMP_BUFFER.Frame` (the jmp_buf's first 8 bytes) and, when nonzero, performs a REAL `RtlUnwindEx` stack unwind — and our one-arg `setjmp` extern leaves that slot holding garbage (the CRT `_setjmp` stores its *second* parameter there; we pass one). Measured: STATUS_BAD_STACK (0xC0000028) in a release probe, GS-cookie aborts (`_report_gsfailure`) under the panic=unwind test harness — the `dyn_eval`/`native_abi` stoppers. Every Rust-side boundary-trap catch on Windows (microtask pump, `js_call_catching`, iterator trampolines, promise combinators) rode this path. Fix: zero the Frame slot before the jump, forcing the non-unwinding POSIX-style `longjmp` whose skipped-cleanup semantics the savepoint restores in `js_throw` already assume. End-to-end validated with a compiled probe (throwing `.then`, `Array.from` mapper, `Promise.all` member, plus a 1000-iteration churn loop) byte-identical to the Node oracle.
- **The conservative-scan register snapshot buffer was under-aligned** (`gc/roots.rs`). MSVC's `_setjmp` saves XMM registers with aligned stores; the `[u64; 32]` buffer is 8-aligned, an immediate access violation whenever it lands 8-mod-16 (measured; this was the `ffi::setjmp` smoke-test AV, same root cause). The snapshot buffer and the three test buffers are now `repr(align(16))`; the extern's docs record both MSVC contracts.

Test-shape fixes, each keeping the subject live on Windows rather than skipping:

- `date`: the TZ-isolation child now uses `TZ=PST8PDT` on Windows — the UCRT's `TZ` parser silently degrades IANA ids to UTC, which failed the test's own subject-is-live guard.
- `gc` malloc-trim: the test counter now records that budgeted reclaim *reached* the trim call (the #6180 subject) rather than only counting the glibc/macOS executing arms, which made the gate unsatisfiable on platforms with no trim primitive.
- `child_process`: `spawnSync` result-shape test spawns `cmd /c echo hi` on Windows (`echo` is a shell builtin there, ENOENT under Node too).
- `ffi::setjmp` smoke tests: aligned buffers (above).

CI: the `windows-build` job now runs `RUST_TEST_THREADS=1 cargo test --profile perry-dev --lib -p perry-runtime` — same single-threaded invocation as the ubuntu leg (#1444), perry-dev profile so it shares the job's build artifacts. Before #7355 there was zero Windows CI to notice the crate didn't compile; this step is what keeps the suite from rotting back to "unmeasurable".

Out of scope, recorded for honesty: the suite has 5 pre-existing failures in *parallel* mode (`closure::dynamic_props`, `gc teardown`, `prop_plan`, `global_this_webassembly`) — cross-thread interference that CI already sidesteps on every platform by running single-threaded.

**Review follow-up (audit of this PR).** Moving the malloc-trim counter to the
top of `run_malloc_trim` made the gate satisfiable on Windows/musl, but it also
silently dropped the stronger property on glibc/macOS: the portable counter
witnesses only that reclaim *reached* the call, so it would pass even if the
platform arm were deleted. The assertion still read "must invoke allocator trim",
which is not what it proved.

Both claims are now asserted separately — a portable `..._CALLS` counter for
"reached" (#6180's actual subject) and a `cfg`-gated `..._EXECUTED` counter,
incremented in both the glibc and Darwin arms, for "a trim primitive actually
ran". Verified the new assertion can fail: removing the Darwin instrumentation
fails the test with "on a target with a trim primitive, budgeted reclaim must
EXECUTE it".
