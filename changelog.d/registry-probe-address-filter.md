### Performance

- **The symbol and class-prototype probes answer "no" from an inlined Bloom
  test instead of a mutex acquisition and a linear scan; the Uint8Array probe
  gets #9272's address window.**

  #9272 put an inline `[lo, hi]` address window in front of `is_registered_buffer`
  and `lookup_typed_array_kind`, and named four probes as the next-largest
  members of the same family. Measured on a symbolized `claude --help`
  (`is_registered_symbol_slow` 0.65%, `is_registered_class_prototype_object`
  0.46%, `is_registered_box_ptr` 0.22%, `is_uint8array_buffer_slow` 0.22%), a
  window is the right fix for exactly one of them.

  Exact uprobe/uretprobe counts from one run — not inferred from the profile:

  | probe | calls | answered "yes" | a window rejects | a filter rejects |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | `is_registered_symbol` | 378,163 | 622 | 38.3% | **99.58%** |
  | `is_uint8array_buffer` | 537,921 | **0** | **100%** | — |
  | `is_registered_class_prototype_object` | 26,290 | 122 | 54.0% | **99.05%** |
  | `is_registered_box_ptr` | 211,148 | **205,640 (97.4%)** | — | — |

  The window column is not a guess: it replays each probe's real argument stream
  against the window its own registrations would have built, widening it exactly
  as `RegistryAddrWindow::admit` does. The filter column does the same against a
  bit-for-bit simulation of the filter that ships here.

  **Why a window fails on two of them.** Buffers and typed arrays sit in their
  own allocations; symbols and class prototypes are ordinary `gc_malloc`'d heap
  objects, interleaved with everything else the program allocates, so `[lo, hi]`
  grows to span ~280 MB of heap and stops discriminating. `RegistryAddrFilter`
  is the same monotone contract — admit before you publish, bits only ever
  set, `false` means "definitively absent" — over a 1,024-bit Bloom filter
  instead of a range. Both shapes are in the tree on purpose; pick by
  measurement.

  For symbols this replaces #9177's `[lo, hi]` range, which sat *inside*
  `is_registered_symbol_slow`: a rejected probe still paid the out-of-line call
  and a `OnceLock` load for an env kill switch before reaching the two bound
  loads. `PERRY_SYMBOL_RANGE_FILTER` is gone with it — it guarded an
  enumeration of the inserters, and the debug-build audit below is strictly
  stronger than an env var nobody sets.

  For class prototypes the filter sits in front of a `map.values().any(…)`
  **linear scan** (#9225) reached through a thread-local and an `RwLock`, whose
  one caller — `descriptor_state::disable_inline_guards_for_descriptor_target`,
  100% of the 26,290 calls — runs on every `Object.defineProperty`, and a bundle's
  `__export(exports, { … })` init runs thousands of those. This does **not**
  close #9225: a false positive still pays the scan, so the table's O(n) slope
  survives at ~1% of its strength, and the O(1) inverse index that issue asks
  for is still the right structural fix.

- **`is_registered_box_ptr` is not a member of this family, and the measurement
  is what says so.** It answers **"yes" 205,640 times out of 211,148** (97.4%)
  — the opposite regime from every other probe here, because its four callers
  (`js_closure_set_box_capture_ptr`, `js_box_get_bits`, `js_box_set_bits`,
  `js_box_capture_cell_ptr`, 100% of calls between them) ask it about *actual
  box pointers* on the async-locals read/write path. A filter in front of it
  could remove at most 2.6% of its 0.22%. It is left alone deliberately; if it
  is attacked again, the target is the cost of the **hit** — the direct-mapped
  positive cache in `tls_hot` — not a rejection filter.

  The filter is 1,024 bits with three probes per address, sized for the ~160
  entries this corpus registers. A much larger bundle can saturate it —
  `CLASS_PROTOTYPE_OBJECTS` grows by one entry per ES5-transpiled constructor —
  and that is a *win* cliff, not a correctness one: a saturated filter is
  exactly the code that ran before it existed. Raising the constant is a
  one-line change; it is deliberately not raised on speculation, because 1,024
  bits is the size every number above was measured at.

  Bits accrue per *admission*, not per live entry: both tables are re-keyed by
  the collector, so an evacuated symbol or prototype is admitted again at its
  new address and the old address's bits stay set. The number that matters is
  therefore the false-positive rate at END of run, and it was measured on the
  shipped binary rather than assumed — see the census below.

#### The census on the shipped binary

Re-running the uretprobe answer census on the built `claude --help` binary,
after the change:

| probe | calls | "yes" |
|---|---|---|
| `is_registered_symbol` | 378,163 → **1,492** | 622 → **622** |
| `is_uint8array_buffer` | 537,921 → **0** | 0 → 0 |
| `is_registered_class_prototype_object` | 26,290 → 26,290 | 122 → **122** |

Every genuine "yes" survives. The symbol filter's 1,492 admissions are 622 real
answers plus 870 false positives — 0.23% of the 377,541 negatives, at the end
of a run in which the population was evacuated and re-admitted throughout. The
class-prototype probe is still *entered* the same number of times (the filter
is inside the function, which has three call sites and is not `#[inline]`);
what it no longer does is the scan, which is where its 0.46% lived.

`--help` output stayed byte-identical to node — 9,175 bytes, rc=0 — in every
arm, before and after.

#### Why it cannot misclassify

These probes classify pointers, so a wrong answer is type confusion rather than
a slow path. A Bloom filter has false positives and no false negatives, which
is the asymmetry the probes need: a false positive costs the ordinary lookup
that was already there.

That leaves one obligation — every registration must admit before it publishes
— and it is not left as an enumeration of writers. Enumerations of writer sets
have produced silent wrong answers in this codebase twice recently, so under
`debug_assertions` **every rejection is re-derived from the authoritative
table**: `SYMBOL_POINTERS` for the symbol filter, `CLASS_PROTOTYPE_OBJECTS` for
the prototype filter, `is_uint8array_buffer_slow` for the Uint8Array window. A
registration route added without admitting panics in the first test that
touches it. The class-prototype table is the harder case — the two GC root
scanners and the per-slot GC step all *rewrite* stored addresses through
`visit_usize_slot`, so each admits what the visitor left behind, under the same
write guard that keeps the new address unfindable until it drops.

`admit` performs its bit-set RMWs unconditionally, with no "already set?"
pre-check, for the reason #9272 gives for the window's: a thread that skips the
RMW performs no acquire, so another thread's admission never joins its
happens-before graph and a reader synchronising only with this thread could
miss it.
