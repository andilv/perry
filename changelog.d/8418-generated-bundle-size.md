### Improved

- Reduced native output for large dependency graphs by removing obsolete
  program-wide class metadata augmentation and by keeping imported JSON
  serialized until `JSON.parse` runs at startup. On the 4,743-module OpenCode
  source build this cut the Windows executable from 1,685.4 MiB to 1,143.7 MiB
  and reduced module-codegen time by 12.8%.
- Added opt-in hybrid size optimization with
  `PERRY_LL_PREOPT_OPTNONE_INSTRS`: generated functions above the configured
  instruction cap skip the LLVM middle-end while ordinary siblings in the same
  codegen unit remain eligible for `-Os`. With an 8,192-instruction cap, the
  same OpenCode executable shrank further to 797.0 MiB (52.7% below baseline);
  module codegen took 88.8 minutes versus the 73.2-minute baseline.
