//! A cached heap value survives — and is rewritten across — a copying
//! minor collection.
//!
//! # Why this is its own test binary
//!
//! The assertion that matters here is that the collector *moved* the
//! cached string and the root scanner rewrote the cache's slot to the
//! forwarded address. Marking alone, or a non-moving collection, satisfies
//! "the value is still readable" without exercising one line of the
//! rewrite path — the #6942/#6946 failure mode, where a gate is green
//! because its subject never ran.
//!
//! Making that assertion meaningful requires a clean heap, and a shared
//! unit-test binary cannot provide one:
//!
//! - The collector conservatively pins any nursery object some stack word
//!   happens to point at. Run after even one other test in the same
//!   binary, this string gets pinned and the minor reports
//!   `copied_objects=0` (measured; alone it reports `copied_objects=1`),
//!   so the relocation assertion fails through no fault of the binding.
//! - Worse, a unit-test binary that has built an ordinary-prototype JS
//!   object with `js_object_alloc` + `js_object_set_field_by_name` — the
//!   obvious way to pass a real options object — makes the copying
//!   collector walk a bogus slot address and SIGSEGV in
//!   `gc::copying::scan_slot`, deterministically under
//!   `--test-threads=1`. Null-prototype objects do not trip it, which is
//!   what both test files now build, but the hazard is a runtime bug
//!   rather than something this binding controls, so this file keeps its
//!   distance from other tests regardless.
//!
//! A dedicated integration binary gets a pristine process: an empty
//! nursery, a shallow stack, and no JS objects. The relocation then
//! happens every run, so the assertion below is a real gate.
//!
//! Note the coverage trade-off: per-PR CI runs `cargo test --lib --bins`,
//! so this suite runs on PRs that touch it (via `e2e-scoped`), on nightly
//! and on tags — not on every PR. That is the price of an assertion that
//! can actually fail; a version of this test that lived in the unit
//! binary could only keep passing while covering nothing.
