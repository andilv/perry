//! #11157: the lexical self-binding of a per-evaluation class DECLARATION.
//!
//! A class declared in a function body (including the body of a CommonJS
//! module wrapper) whose heritage is a runtime value or that has private
//! elements lowers to a `ClassExprFresh` object per evaluation. Its static
//! fields live on that object. Before this module, the class's own members
//! resolved its name to `ClassRef(<template>)`, so `C.count = C.count + 1` in
//! a static method read and wrote the shared template, never the object
//! whose statics were initialized, and a static-field arrow's `this` was
//! the template too. bson's `ObjectId.getInc()` (`class ObjectId extends
//! BSONValue` inside `bson.cjs`) returned 1 on every call as a result.
//!
//! Named class EXPRESSIONS already get a compiler-private self-binding local
//! (`class_expr_self_bindings`, see `arm_class.rs`) that codegen fills with
//! the evaluated class object before any static initializer runs. These
//! helpers give a class declaration the same binding when it is known up
//! front to take the fresh path.
