//! #8882/#8730: an unresolved `new` names the identifier and defers to a
//! runtime global lookup. Split from `tests.rs` for the 2000-line cap.

/// #8882 / #8730: a constructor name that resolves to nothing in the module
/// is read off `globalThis` when the `new` executes — exactly like a bare
/// identifier read — so a runtime-created global constructs and a true miss
/// throws `ReferenceError: <name> is not defined` WITH the identifier. The
/// `typeof`-guarded browser-API shape is the one Next's `app-page` runtime
/// carries; it previously lowered to the nameless throw even though the guard
/// makes the branch dead on a server.
