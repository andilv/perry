//! #11250: keep class-capture refreshes from reading a `for (let …)` head
//! binding outside the iteration that owns it.
//!
//! A refresh (`RegisterClassCaptures` / `RefreshClassExprCaptures`) re-reads
//! every capture of its class. A class that closed over a per-iteration head
//! binding `i` may only re-read `i` inside the loop body: the head's condition
//! and update already run against the NEXT iteration's binding, and after the
//! loop the single HIR slot for `i` holds the post-increment value. The refresh
//! passes in `expr_function.rs` place refreshes by assignment site and before
//! returns, whatever capture triggered them, so a write to another capture
//! (`i++, x++`), a later `return`, or the loop head itself would otherwise
//! overwrite the last class's `i` with the value that stopped the loop.
//!
//! The refresh itself must still run: it also carries the other captures,
//! e.g. a `const` declared after the loop that the class read while still in
//! its TDZ. So a per-object refresh keeps every in-scope capture and re-reads
//! an expired head from the class object's own capture slot instead. The
//! name-keyed `RegisterClassCaptures` snapshot has no per-evaluation slot to
//! re-read and is dropped; the per-object refresh is authoritative over it.
//!
//! A class-environment refresh (`env_class: Some`) is rewritten the same way.
//! Only a fresh class expression can close over a loop-head binding in env
//! mode: a class declaration in a loop body is `Repeatable` (per-instance
//! snapshot) and a run-once definition is never inside a loop. A fresh class
//! expression is GUARDED: every evaluation, owner included, still carries its
//! own `__perry_ctor_caps` array, the refresh rebuilds that array, and
//! `js_class_env_refresh` copies it into the environment slots only for the
//! class's first (owner) evaluation. Re-reading the expired head from the
//! array therefore republishes the value the evaluation already holds. The
//! array and the owner's slots cannot disagree on a head binding: a member
//! that writes it makes it a shared-mutable capture (the loop head writes it
//! too), which `shared_mutable_capture` boxes, so both hold the same box.
