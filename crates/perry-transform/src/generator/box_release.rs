//! #7933: releasing an async activation's boxed body locals at its terminal
//! state.
//!
//! The async-to-generator transform boxes every body local of an `async`
//! function (`Stmt::PreallocateBoxes`, one `js_box_alloc_bits` cell per local
//! per invocation) so the synthesized state-machine closures can share them
//! across suspends. Box cells are registered in the runtime's `BOX_REGISTRY`,
//! and `scan_box_roots_mut` marks the JSValue inside every registered cell on
//! every collection. So every local of every activation the program has *ever*
//! run used to stay a live GC root for the life of the process.
//!
//! #7933 (PR #7939) fixed the *retention* half by clearing the releasable cells
//! at a terminal state. It deliberately did not free them: registry
//! monotonicity was what made perry#4898's pointer rejection and #7906's
//! positive pointer cache sound. The cost of that choice was the other half of
//! the bug — cell + registry bytes per completed activation, growing linearly,
//! invisible to every GC counter because none of it is in the GC heap.
//!
//! #8208 makes the release real. `Stmt::ReleaseBoxes` lowers to
//! `js_box_release` / `js_i32_box_release` / `js_bool_box_release`, which clear
//! the cell, de-register it, evict its positive-cache slot, and park it in a
//! per-activation release range. Queued and running `Task::AsyncStep`s retain
//! the activation; its zero-reference transition publishes that range to a
//! free pool, and `js_*box_alloc*` pops the pool before calling `std::alloc`.
//! Untracked runtime releases retain the old whole-pump quarantine as a
//! conservative fallback. Registry membership is therefore no longer
//! monotonic — but the property perry#4898 and #7906 actually depend on
//! survives untouched, because cell memory is never handed back to the
//! allocator: an address minted by `js_box_alloc*` stays 8 readable bytes of
//! box cell for the life of the thread, so "was a box" can never become "is
//! another object".
//!
//! Closure-visible cells are named by the terminal release too, but the runtime
//! keeps them live and registered while a GC closure still carries their raw
//! address. Closure move/death hooks maintain per-cell capture counts. Once the
//! queued/running activation steps drain, every uncaptured cell publishes and
//! each captured cell waits independently for its final count to disappear.
//! Thus one escaped closure does not retain the complete activation frame.
