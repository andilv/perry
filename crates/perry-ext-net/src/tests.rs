/// #11155: `adopt_upgraded_tcp_stream` adopts on the calling thread's own loop
/// or refuses outright. It used to park the stream in a process-wide map and
/// post the adoption with no agent named, so a caller that did not own the
/// loop reached whichever agent the runtime defaulted to, and the socket id it
/// returned could be adopted onto another agent's loop.
///
/// Both halves are observed, and both run every time. A thread of the agent
/// that is not its owner must get `INVALID_HANDLE`, register nothing, and close
/// the stream (the peer reads EOF, the witness that nothing kept it parked).
/// The owner's adoption must land on its own loop: the driver holds one more
/// handle before the call returns, with no turn run in between.
///
/// **Why the test mints its own agent.** An unclaimed libtest thread resolves
/// to the PRIMARY agent, whose route slot belongs to whichever test thread
/// asked first, for as long as that thread lives. This test used to spawn its
/// "non-owner" from such a thread and assume the route was settled. It was
/// not: when this thread had been declined, the owner was some other test's
/// thread, and if that thread exited first its `ClaimGuard` released the slot,
/// so the spawned thread found no route, claimed the loop itself, and got a
/// socket id (#11597; intermittent on Linux and macOS alike, 0 of 300 runs
/// with one test thread). That is the documented first-to-ask rule, not a
/// leak: the route of a dead owner is free. A fresh agent has an empty slot
/// nobody else can name, so here the owner is this test's own thread, alive
/// until the refusal has been observed.
