//! #4973 — adopt an already-connected TCP stream as a `net.Socket`

//! under the 2000-line CI gate.

/// Adopt an already-connected TCP stream as a `net.Socket` handle.
///
/// perry-ext-http's raw `'upgrade'` paths (#4973) call this: Node hands the
/// `'upgrade'` listener the raw connection socket with nothing written to it,
/// so the HTTP side peels the response or request head off a stream *another*
/// transport opened and passes the live stream here. The returned id drives
/// the standard socket surface (`write` / `end` / `on('data')` / …) exactly
/// like a socket accepted by `net.createServer`.
///
/// The stream becomes a turnloop socket: its descriptor is handed to the
/// agent's loop (`turnloop_net::adopt_stream`) and read there, so this crate
/// needs no socket task of its own for it. That happens on the loop's owner —
/// the caller is a worker thread of the transport that opened the stream,
/// which must never claim a loop — so the stream is parked in
/// [`pending_adoptions`] and a job to adopt it is *posted*, and the id is
/// returned before it has run.
///
/// Whichever reaches the parked stream first adopts it: the posted job, or
/// [`ensure_adopted_socket_dispatch`] on the owner, which the HTTP side calls
/// from its upgrade-event drain before any listener can touch the socket. That
/// second route is what makes the order safe: without it, a drain that ran
/// before the owner's next turn would hand JS a socket the loop had not adopted
/// yet, and its first `write()` would find no handle.
///
/// Does NOT register the GC scanner or the runtime dispatch extensions — those
/// are main-thread-affine; call `ensure_adopted_socket_dispatch()` from the
/// main thread (the upgrade-event drain does) before user code touches the
/// socket.
///
/// Returns `INVALID_HANDLE`, with the stream closed, when the handle-id band is
/// exhausted or no loop exists for this agent; the caller aborts the upgrade.
