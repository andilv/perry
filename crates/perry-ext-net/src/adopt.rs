//! #4973 — adopt an already-connected TCP stream as a `net.Socket`
//! (the HTTP raw-`'upgrade'` handoff), plus the base64 helper the
//! string-encoding data delivery uses. Split out of `lib.rs` to keep it
//! under the 2000-line CI gate.

/// Adopt an already-connected TCP stream as a `net.Socket` handle.
///
/// Node hands an `'upgrade'` listener the raw connection socket with nothing
/// written to it; this publishes a live stream some other code connected under
/// the standard socket surface (`write` / `end` / `on('data')` / …), exactly
/// like a socket accepted by `net.createServer`. perry-ext-http's own raw
/// `'upgrade'` paths no longer come here — they keep the connection on the
/// loop and move it with `turnloop_net::transfer` ([`adopt_turnloop_upgrade`]).
///
/// The stream becomes a turnloop socket: its descriptor is handed to the
/// agent's loop (`turnloop_net::adopt_stream`) and read there, **synchronously,
/// on the calling thread**, which must be a JS agent thread that owns that
/// loop — never a transport's worker thread, which asking would make claim a
/// loop nobody turns (`turnloop_io::post_to_owner`). There is deliberately no
/// posting route (#11155). The one this replaced parked the stream in a
/// process-wide map and posted the adoption without naming an agent, so a
/// caller on a tokio worker — which acts for no agent — reached the *primary*
/// agent's loop whoever owned the connection, and any loop draining that map
/// could adopt another agent's stream onto its own thread and heap. A socket
/// belongs to one loop from creation to close; the caller that knows which
/// loop that is is the one that has to be on it.
///
/// Returns `INVALID_HANDLE`, with the stream closed and nothing registered,
/// when the handle-id band is exhausted, when this thread does not own its
/// agent's loop, or when the loop refuses the descriptor. The caller must treat
/// that as a failed upgrade (Node emits `'error'`), never hand JS the `0` as a
/// socket. Call [`ensure_adopted_socket_dispatch`] before user code touches a
/// socket this returns.
