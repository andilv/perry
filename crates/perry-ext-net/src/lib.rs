//! Native bindings for Node `net.Socket` — TCP plus optional TLS upgrade.
//!
//! Ported from `crates/perry-stdlib/src/net/mod.rs` to perry-ffi v0.5.x's
//! stable surface as part of #466 Phase 5. Every socket and listener lives on
//! the agent's turnloop loop (`turnloop_io`): one multishot read per socket,
//! submissions made where the FFI call happens, and completions turned into
//! `PendingNetEvent`s by this crate's sink. Read data is queued as a zero-copy
//! `Bytes` view into `NET_PENDING_EVENTS` and converted to `Buffer` on the JS
//! thread inside `js_net_process_pending` — the arena-safety rule (JSValue
//! construction MUST run on the agent's own thread, never in the I/O path).
//!
//! TLS runs as a sans-I/O rustls session *above* the turnloop handle
//! (`turnloop_tls_io`), for both `tls.connect` and `socket.upgradeToTLS`.
//!
//! This crate has no tokio. The tokio socket task that used to back a thread
//! with no loop of its own is replaced by posting to the thread that owns the
//! agent's loop (`turnloop_io::on_loop`); see that module's header.
//!
//! # Differences from the perry-stdlib version
//!
//! - Uses perry-ffi closures, buffers, and mutable GC root scanning; the latter
//!   rewrites listener pointers after a copying minor collection.
//!
//! TLS is unconditionally compiled in (no `#[cfg(feature = "tls")]` gates
//! like perry-stdlib has) — keeping the wrapper crate simple, the deps are
//! small. perry-stdlib's umbrella `net = ["async-runtime"]` + separate
//! `tls = ["net", ...]` feature split is preserved on the perry-stdlib side
//! for backwards compat; the well-known flip routes here.
