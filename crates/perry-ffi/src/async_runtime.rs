//! Async-runtime bridge for native bindings (added in v0.5.1 of
//! the perry-ffi v0.5 surface — non-breaking; pure additions).
//!
//! Many wrappers (bcrypt, argon2, sharp, …) need to do CPU-bound or
//! blocking work without stalling Perry's main thread. perry-stdlib
//! owns a main-thread-pumped resolution queue and routes blocking work
//! to turnloop's shared worker sets; this module exposes that surface
//! through a stable C ABI so external wrappers use the same machinery
//! instead of spawning their own.
//!
//! There is no tokio behind any of it. `spawn_async` and
//! `spawn_blocking_with_reactor`, whose contract was "tokio's reactor is
//! ambient", were retired together with tokio (see the ABI page's
//! "Retired" section); socket work belongs on [`crate::turnloop_net`] /
//! [`crate::agent_post`], CPU work on [`spawn_blocking`] or the v2
//! [`crate::pool`].
//!
//! # Layered design
//!
//! 1. perry-stdlib provides `#[no_mangle] extern "C"` shims (see
//!    `crates/perry-stdlib/src/perry_ffi_async.rs`).
//! 2. This module declares those symbols `extern "C"` and exposes
//!    safe Rust wrappers — [`JsPromise`] and [`spawn_blocking`].
//! 3. External wrappers depend only on perry-ffi. At link time,
//!    perry-stdlib's archive resolves the `perry_ffi_*` symbols.
//!
//! # Invariants
//!
//! - A `JsPromise` is owned by Perry's runtime arena from
//!   construction onwards. Once resolved or rejected, the
//!   underlying `Promise` is consumed by the awaiter.
//! - The "bits" passed to [`JsPromise::resolve_string`] are NaN-boxed
//!   `JSValue` representations. [`JsPromise::reject_string`] copies its
//!   message and constructs the corresponding JavaScript `Error` on the main
//!   thread, so wrapper authors don't need to know the runtime layout.
