//! Process-global `SharedArrayBuffer` backing store + registry (#4913 Stage 2).
//!
//! A `SharedArrayBuffer` is the one JavaScript value whose bytes must alias the
//! same physical memory across every `perry/thread` agent. Ordinary buffers are
//! thread-local slab / arena allocations whose addresses are only meaningful on
//! the owning thread, and crossing a thread boundary deep-copies them — so they
//! cannot back cross-agent `Atomics` coordination.
//!
//! SAB backing is therefore allocated directly from the global allocator,
//! never freed (matching Perry's "buffers live for the life of the process"
//! model — see `buffer::header`), and recorded in a process-global registry so
//! any thread can:
//!   * recognise a raw pointer as a shared backing store (during cross-thread
//!     serialization, before the missing `GcHeader` would be misread), and
//!   * re-register it in its own thread-local buffer / SAB tables when the
//!     value arrives from another agent.
//!
//! Because the address is a stable, process-wide heap address, an `Atomics`
//! slot inside a SAB has the same absolute byte address on every thread — which
//! is exactly the key the futex wait/notify table ([`crate::atomics_futex`])
//! uses to match a `notify` on one agent with a `wait` parked on another.
