///
/// The ordering is the safety argument, and it is compare-then-dereference at

///
/// * `proto_addr` is re-read from `CACHED_OBJECT_PROTO_BITS` — a GC MUTABLE
///   root (`scan_parse_roots_mut`), so an evacuation rewrites it — and is
///   compared BEFORE anything is dereferenced. A match means the root still
///   names the very allocation `object_proto_tojson_signature` proved to be a
///   live, non-forwarded `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` when the verdict was recorded. A
///   relocation rewrites the root and lands here as a MISMATCH, which falls
///   through to the full recompute. That is the same moving-GC defence the
///   validated builder relies on, stated as a comparison instead of a probe.
/// * the keys array address is likewise re-read out of the live prototype's
///   keys slot and compared before `length` / `capacity` are touched.
/// * a header address is `addr - GC_HEADER_SIZE` for arena and malloc
///   allocations alike (`value::addr_class::classify_tracked_gc_header_with`),
///   so no address is taken FROM the cache and dereferenced: every dereference
///   is of an address just re-derived from a live root, after that address
///   compared equal to a validated one.
/// * that ordering establishes the addresses are the *validated* ones. It does
///   not establish they are addresses at all if the root is corrupted or has
///   been zeroed under us, which is why the magnitude classification stays:
///   `try_read_gc_header` rejects the handle band and out-of-range garbage
///   before `addr - GC_HEADER_SIZE` is formed, and it is the module-owned
///   predicate rather than a re-typed literal
///   (`scripts/addr_class_inventory.py` enforces that).
///
/// Worth 584 instructions per object visited, 260 of them the two arena-range
/// classifications this skips (#10696). Keeping the magnitude guard costs 10
/// of those back: the executed fast path is 49 instructions with a bare cast

/// costs. `try_read_gc_header_known_plausible` is deliberately NOT used here:
/// `buffer::is_small_buf_slab_addr` has been a constant `false` since the

/// would miss, so the probe can skip the generic dispatcher entirely. The
/// generic walk can only produce a `toJSON` from four places, each covered
/// here:
///
/// Own/class/prototype checks use direct reads, but the first default-prototype
/// lookup can initialize globalThis and allocate its lookup key. Callers that
/// need the receiver afterward must root it across this probe. The data-only
/// emitter uses `to_json_definitely_absent_without_gc` to decline that lookup.
///
/// 1. an OWN key (object-literal method, expando, or an
///    `Object.defineProperty` accessor — all of which register the key in
///    `keys_array`), or a hidden native-backing marker key that forwards
///    reads to a `toJSON`-bearing native surface —
///    `keys_array_may_carry_to_json`;
/// 2. a class prototype/vtable/prototype-object method anywhere on the class
///    parent chain — `class_chain_may_have_to_json` (HIR lowers even plain
///    object literals to anonymous shape classes, so `class_id != 0` alone
///    proves nothing: the registries must actually be consulted);
/// 3. an explicitly recorded `[[Prototype]]` (`Object.setPrototypeOf`, or
///    `Object.create` with a Proxy prototype) — any recorded entry defers to
///    the slow path;
/// 4. a `toJSON` monkey-patched onto the default `Object.prototype` —
///    `object_proto_may_have_to_json` (verdict cached under a live mutation
///    signature across callback-free specialized stringify calls).
///
/// Before this probe, every object literal paid ~3 recursive
/// `js_object_get_field_by_name` miss cascades per stringify call — ~90% of
/// `JSON.stringify` time on small objects and a ~250x gap vs V8 (#6009).
