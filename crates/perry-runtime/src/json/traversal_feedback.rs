//! Per-thread feedback: do this thread's lazy JSON arrays get fully traversed?
//!
//! A top-level JSON array parses onto a validating tape and materializes its
//! elements on demand. That wins whenever the caller touches a few elements --
//! `parse` and `sparse` shapes run at ~0.4x the better of Node and Bun -- but a
//! program that then walks EVERY element pays for two tokenizations: the tape
//! build, and the per-record reparse the scan flip hands to the direct parser.
//! Profiled on records_array_1m:scan: 26.7% tape build, 43.1% record reparse,
//! 1.13x the better engine; on records_array_16k:scan, 1.23x. The same inputs
//! parsed eagerly run at 0.97x and 0.76x.
//!
//! No size threshold can pick between the two, because the direct parser is
//! also the WRONG choice for some arrays nobody traverses: heterogeneous_1m's
//! 32 record shapes cost it 2.89x CPU and 3.31x RSS where the tape takes 0.35x
//! and 0.66x. So the decision follows behaviour instead. Every lazy array
//! created costs a point of evidence; every traversal flip earns two. Once the
//! score shows traversal is the norm, eligible parses go eagerly, and one in
//! [`RESAMPLE_EVERY`] still goes lazily so a program that stops traversing
//! drifts back. Parse-only and sparse-access programs never flip, so they never
//! leave the tape.
//!
//! Measured across all 50 JSON matrix cells in one binary, against the tape-only
//! route: records_array_16k:scan 1.23x -> 0.78x, records_array_1m:scan
//! 1.11x -> 0.98x, records_array_8m:scan CPU 0.93x -> 0.77x and RSS 190 ->
//! 163 MiB; every other cell unchanged.
//!
//! Only element-by-element reads in `lazy_get_rooted` count (the flip, or an
//! in-order read of the last element). Stringify,
//! revivers, array methods and mutation also force materialization, but none of
//! them is evidence that a scan would have been cheaper eagerly.
