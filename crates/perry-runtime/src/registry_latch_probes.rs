//! Correctness tests for the monotone side-table probe latches.
//!
//! The latches in [`crate::registry_latch`] make "is this value special?" free
//! for programs that never use the feature. Speed is the easy half; the hard
//! half is that a program which *does* use the feature must still work, and in
//! particular must still work when the feature is first used **after** the
//! probe's idle fast path has already been taken. Every test below therefore
//! takes the fast path first and only then registers.
//!
//! The `latch_semantics` tests at the bottom prove the ordering rule is
//! load-bearing rather than decorative: they model both orderings of
//! arm-vs-insert and show that only the wrong one can be observed as
//! "idle while the table already holds the entry".
