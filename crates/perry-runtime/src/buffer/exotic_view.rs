//! #8149: which registered buffers carry integer-indexed own properties.
//!
//! Perry backs FOUR distinct JS types with the same `BufferHeader` + the same
//! `BUFFER_REGISTRY` entry: a node `Buffer`, a `Uint8Array`, an
//! `ArrayBuffer`/`SharedArrayBuffer`, and a `DataView`. Only the first two are
//! *integer-indexed exotic objects*. The other two have **no** integer-indexed
//! own properties at all:
//!
//! ```js
//! const dv = new DataView(new ArrayBuffer(8));
//! dv[0]        // undefined  — not the byte
//! dv.length    // undefined  — DataView has byteLength, not length
//! 0 in dv      // false
//! dv[0] = 7    // an ORDINARY own property "0"; the byte stays 0
//! Object.keys(dv)  // ["0"] — the expando, never the bytes
//! ```
//!
//! Every consumer that triaged a receiver as "registered buffer ⇒ byte
//! indexable" served all four, so a `DataView` and a raw `ArrayBuffer` answered
//! bytes for `[i]`, `in`, `.length` and `hasOwnProperty`, and an index STORE
//! overwrote a byte where node creates a property.
//!
//! The discriminating question is asked ABOVE the byte arm, never below it:
//! the byte arm answers unconditionally, so a re-check placed after it is dead
//! code. This is the same ordering rule #8090 / #8109 / #8119 / #8120 / #8124 /
//! #8140 / #8141 / #8148 / #8173 each had to restore.
//!
//! Both backings are covered by construction. `is_registered_buffer` is a
//! side-table membership test, not an address-range or GC-header probe, so an
//! EXTERNAL buffer (no `GcHeader` at all — see `array/header.rs`'s
//! `array_receiver_gc_tag` doc, #8142) is classified by exactly the same
//! lookups as an arena-backed one.
