//! turnloop P4: Perry's blocking and CPU-bound work on turnloop's shared
//! bounded pool (DESIGN §12 "P4", D8, §9).
//!
//! P1 moved sockets onto the loop, P2 the child pipes, datagrams and signals,
//! P3 the timer heap. What is left of "work that must not run on the JS
//! thread" is the class libuv calls threadpool work: password hashing, image
//! processing, compression, key derivation, name resolution and an addon's
//! `napi_queue_async_work`. Perry ran each of those on a *different* mechanism
//! — tokio's blocking pool for bcrypt and every `perry_ffi::spawn_blocking`
//! caller, one fresh `std::thread` per N-API async work item, and, for argon2,
//! the KDFs, the zlib one-shots and `dns.lookup`, no offloading at all: the
//! work ran inline on the thread that owns the JS heap and only the *callback*
//! was deferred.
//!
//! This module is the one mechanism that replaces all of them:
//! [`Loop::blocking`](turnloop::Loop::blocking) submits an owned `Send`
//! closure to the process-wide bounded pool, and its result comes back as an
//! ordinary turnloop completion on the thread that submitted it.
//!
//! # The contract, and why it is shaped like this
//!
//! A job is two closures, and the split is the whole point:
//!
//! - `work` runs **on a pool thread**. It is `FnOnce() -> T + Send`, so the
//!   only thing that can cross is owned Rust data. It cannot touch the JS
//!   heap: perry-runtime's arena is thread-local, and a JSValue built on a
//!   pool thread lands in an arena the owning thread will never see (#1824).
//! - `deliver` runs **on the owning thread**, inside the completion dispatch
//!   that follows a turn. It receives the `T` the pool produced and is where
//!   JS values get built, promises settle and callbacks are queued. It is
//!   deliberately **not** `Send`.
//!
//! That is `spawn_for_promise_deferred`'s rule (DESIGN §9 "Thread-pool jobs
//! touching JS: never") expressed in the type system instead of in a comment.
//!
//! # Completion routing
//!
//! One token space, disjoint from P1's `1..=7`, P2's `0x10..=0x1F` and P3's
//! `TIMER_TOKEN` by construction: the top 8 bits are the operation class
//! (`0x20..=0x2F`), the low 56 the job id. [`owns`] is the range test
//! `agent_loop::dispatch_staged` routes on, so no module can be handed
//! another's completion and a stale token finds no entry and is dropped.
//!
//! # Exactly-once
//!
//! Every accepted job produces exactly one [`Delivery`] (DESIGN D4): `Done`
//! when the pool ran it, `Cancelled` when [`cancel`] won the race with the
//! pool thread or the loop shut down with the job still outstanding, `Failed`
//! when the job panicked on the pool thread (turnloop catches the unwind).
//! A submission the driver *refuses* never becomes a job at all and reports
//! through `submit`'s return value instead, so a caller never has to guess
//! whether its `deliver` will run.
//!
//! # GC
//!
//! **No JS heap memory reaches the pool**, the property P1 and P2 established:
//! `work` is `Send` and JS values are not, so the compiler rejects the mistake
//! rather than the reviewer having to catch it.
//!
//! What *is* new here is that a job has a lifetime, and a caller may need a JS
//! value to survive it — `zlib.gzip(buf, cb)` has to hold `cb` from submission
//! until the compression finishes. Such a value is parked in the job entry
//! through [`submit_rooted`] and visited by this module's registered
//! `gc_register_mutable_root_scanner`, so a moving collector rewrites it and
//! hands the rewritten value to `deliver`. A raw heap pointer held in a
//! runtime-side table is a GC root and the static checker cannot see it
//! (CLAUDE.md); registering the scanner in the same file as the holder is what
//! keeps that true.
