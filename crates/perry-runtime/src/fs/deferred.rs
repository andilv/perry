//! #9442 — deferred async fs writes.
//!
//! Node's `fs.writeFile` / `fs.appendFile` — both the callback form and the
//! `fs/promises` form — hand the work to the libuv thread pool and return.
//! Nothing has touched the file when the call returns, and `process.exit()`
//! does not drain that pool: an exit in the same tick abandons the write.
//!
//! Perry did the write SYNCHRONOUSLY inside the call and returned an
//! already-settled promise (or a deferred callback over an already-committed
//! write). There was no in-flight work left for `process.exit()` to abandon, so
//! five fire-and-forget `appendFile` calls followed by `process.exit(0)` landed
//! five records where Node lands none — perry committed state a program had
//! deliberately walked away from.
//!
//! The fix keeps the work synchronous but moves it OFF the calling turn: the
//! operation is parked on a zero-delay callback timer, the same mechanism
//! `fs::stream`'s `schedule_drain` uses. That buys three properties at once,
//! all of them already load-bearing elsewhere in the runtime, none of them
//! newly invented here:
//!
//!   * the timer queue GC-roots the closure and therefore its captured path /
//!     data / options / sink values, so they survive the turn;
//!   * a pending callback timer is a live event source
//!     (`js_callback_timer_has_pending`), so a program that ends by draining
//!     its loop still lands every record, and an `await` on the returned
//!     promise still resolves;
//!   * `process.exit()` terminates through `libc::_exit` without ticking the
//!     timer queues, so the parked write is dropped exactly as Node drops it.
//!
//! Argument validation that THROWS stays on the calling turn (see the
//! `validate::*` calls in the schedulers below), so a bad path or a bad options
//! object still raises where it did before rather than turning into an uncaught
//! exception inside a timer.
