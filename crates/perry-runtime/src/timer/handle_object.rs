//! Split out of `timer.rs` to keep that file under the 2000-line size gate
//! (`scripts/check_file_size.sh`). The boundary is the whole of the handle's
//! object model and nothing else: its two class ids, the packed
//! `ObjectMeta.native_state` word, the per-realm prototype singletons and
//! their GC root scan, the prototype/constructor installers, the receiver
//! plumbing every prototype method shares, and the allocator `timer_object`.
//!
//! What stays in `timer.rs` is the scheduler: the queues, the tick loops, the
//! `js_set_*` / `clear*` entry points and the mock-timer surface. The seam
//! between the two is deliberately narrow -- the scheduler calls
//! `timer_object(id, kind)` to wrap an id it has just minted, and reads an id
//! back out with `timer_handle_id` / `timer_handle_parts`.

// ===========================================================================
// Honest tags (#340/#341): a `Timeout` / `Immediate` handed to JS is an
// ORDINARY object.
//
// `setTimeout` used to return its registry id NaN-boxed with `POINTER_TAG`,
// so a timer was a small integer pretending to be a pointer. That id is not
// even unambiguous: `primitive_methods.rs` had to document that "timer ids and
// perry-ffi registry handles share the pointer-tagged small-integer band and
// both count from 1", so a live HTTP/2 server handle 1 and a `setTimeout` id 1
// were the same value and the method dispatch had to guess between them.
//
// The value JS receives is now a `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` with a family class id, a
// real ShapeId and a per-family prototype carrying `ref` / `unref` / `hasRef` /
// `refresh` / `close`, `Symbol.dispose` and (Timeout only, matching node)
// `Symbol.toPrimitive`. The registry id rides in `ObjectMeta.native_state`, so
// the id stays the runtime's internal currency and only the JS-visible handle
// changes. Seven dispatch arms keyed on `is_known_timer_id` go away with it.
//
// State word: bit 0 present, bit 1 immediate, bits 8.. the timer id.
