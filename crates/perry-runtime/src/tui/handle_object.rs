//! The JS-visible `perry/tui` handle objects (#340/#341).
//!
//! Everything `perry/tui` hands back to TypeScript — a widget from `Text` /
//! `Box` / `Table` / …, a `state(0)` container, a `useRef` box, and the
//! `useApp` / `useStdout` / `useFocusManager` singletons — used to be a small
//! registry integer NaN-boxed with `POINTER_TAG`. Six independent id spaces
//! shared that one encoding and every one of them counts from a small
//! constant, so the values COLLIDED:
//!
//! ```text
//! useApp()          -> 1     Text("hi")       -> 1    useRef(x) (first) -> 1
//! useStdout()       -> 2     Box()            -> 2    useRef(y) (second)-> 2
//! useFocusManager() -> 3     Spacer()         -> 3
//! state(0) (first)  -> 0     <- POINTER_TAG | 0: a null pointer wearing the
//!                               pointer tag
//! ```
//!
//! So `useApp() === Text("hi")` was `true`, a `Map` keyed on two different
//! handles collapsed to one entry, and the first `state(0)` of a program was
//! literally a tagged null. None of that is reachable through a type error —
//! the values are indistinguishable at run time, because the encoding carries
//! no provenance.
//!
//! A tui handle is now an ORDINARY object: `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` with a real
//! ShapeId, a per-kind class id in the web-builtin block and (for the kinds
//! that have a method surface) a per-kind prototype. The registry id rides in
//! `ObjectMeta.native_state`, so the id stays the module's internal currency —
//! the widget tree, the layout pass, the paint pass and the hook slots all
//! still speak ids — and only the value that crosses into JS changes.
//!
//! The boundary is exactly the `#[no_mangle]` FFI surface: a producer wraps an
//! id on its way out, a consumer resolves an object back to an id on the way
//! in, and nothing between them changes. A raw argument is not a GC root, so
//! every consumer resolves at entry, before anything that can allocate.
//!
//! State word: bit 0 present, bits 8.. the registry id. The KIND is not in the
//! word — it is the class id on the object header, which is also what brands a
//! prototype method against a foreign receiver.
