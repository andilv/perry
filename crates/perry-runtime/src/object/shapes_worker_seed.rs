//! Charter step 5, P4: a worker agent sees every codegen ShapeId with its rep.
//!
//! A `perry/thread` worker never runs module initialization, so the ShapeIds
//! module init minted (class birth shapes, codegen literal shapes) are absent
//! from its fresh agent table. The inline bump allocator stamps such an id
//! with no runtime call, so the first allocation of a class in a worker can be
//! an inline one: the id must already name its descriptor, with its rep, in
//! that agent. The spawner therefore hands the worker its external carriers
//! (the ids codegen holds in module globals), and the worker installs them
//! before it runs any user code. This is a copy of the spawner's own facts,
//! taken at spawn; nothing process-global is kept.
