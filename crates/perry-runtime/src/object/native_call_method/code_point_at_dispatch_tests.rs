//! #9761: `String.prototype.codePointAt` must be answered by the native
//! string-method dispatch, not by the primitive-method FALLBACK.
//!
//! The fallback (`call_primitive_builtin_prototype_method`) resolves
//! `globalThis.String.prototype[<name>]`, clones that closure to rebind `this`,
//! and — because the resolved thunk is not registered strict — runs `ToObject`
//! on the receiver, minting a `String` wrapper with an own index property per
//! UTF-16 code unit. `codePointAt` had a prototype thunk but no dispatch arm,
//! and grapheme-aware text measurement calls it once per character: on the
//! compiled claude-code TUI it was the ONLY name reaching the fallback, at
//! 99,008 calls (and 99,008 wrappers) per 400-character streamed reply.
//!
//! The assertion is the wrapper count, not the return value: a test that only
//! checked the answer would pass with the arm deleted, because the fallback
//! computes the same number — expensively. `BOXED_PRIMITIVE_PAYLOADS` gains one
//! entry per wrapper, so "no new boxed primitives" is exactly "the fallback did
//! not run".
