//! Method calls on a function object, answered from its SHAPE.
//!
//! A closure on its base Function shape (`closure::shape`) has exactly the
//! intrinsic own keys (`name`, `length`, `prototype`) and inherits from the
//! prototype its shape names. So for any other key the answer is the
//! prototype's own slot, and the call is decided by that slot's VALUE:
//!
//! 1. one compare: the receiver's +4 word is this agent's base Function
//!    ShapeId (ownership then proven by the tracked GC header);
//! 2. one lookup: the key's data slot on `Function.prototype`;
//! 3. identity by value: the slot still holds the intrinsic `bind` / `call` /
//!    `apply` closure (its code pointer) — then run exactly what the by-name
//!    tower runs for those three (`dispatch_function_proto_method`).
//!
//! Anything else (another value in the slot — a patch —, an accessor, a key
//! the prototype lacks, a FunctionDictionary receiver) is `None`: the caller
//! runs its full path unchanged. No name decides anything; the slot does.
