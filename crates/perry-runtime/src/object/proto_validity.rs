//! Prototype-mutation validity: one word that stands for "no object anybody
//! inherits from has changed structurally since you looked".
//!
//! # The problem this replaces
//!
//! A mutation of an object that is used as a prototype is invisible to the
//! objects that inherit from it. Perry does not record that an ordinary object
//! is somebody's prototype, so `proto.b = 1` transitions `proto`'s shape and
//! nothing else: no epoch moves, no instance is touched, and a cache that
//! remembers "key `a` lives on `proto` at slot 3" has no way to notice.
//!
//! The inherited-read cache's first answer (#10834) was to re-prove the chain
//! on every hit: one ShapeId compare per hop, up to four dependent loads
//! through prototype objects that are usually cold. That is correct, and it
//! has two costs. It is proportional to the DEPTH of the chain, so a deep
//! chain pays for its depth on every read; and, decisively for the emitted
//! sequence this campaign is aiming at, it is a LOOP — compiled code at a
//! property-read site cannot emit a variable number of compares, so as long as
//! the chain check is per-hop the hit can only live behind a call.
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! This is V8's prototype validity cell, collapsed to one global counter:
//!
//! 1. An object is MARKED (`OBJECT_META_FLAG_IS_PROTOTYPE` in its
//!    `ObjectMeta`) by the `[[Prototype]]` INSTALL funnel — every link kind in
//!    `prototype_chain::object_set_static_prototype_impl`, plus
//!    `class_prototype_object_root_store`. The inherited-read cache does NOT
//!    mark: it REFUSES to record a hop that is not already marked.
//!
//!    The cache's prime is the SAFETY NET, not the authority: when it meets an
//!    unmarked hop it marks that hop and ABANDONS the walk without recording
//!    anything, so the next read of the pair primes normally. Coverage is
//!    therefore self-healing — an install route this funnel misses costs one
//!    declined read, not a permanent loss — while the invariant that matters
//!    still holds absolutely: **no entry is ever recorded through a hop that
//!    was not already marked before the walk began.**
//!
//!    That polarity is the point. The first version of this flag was set BY
//!    the prime, for the hop it was about to record, which made the coverage
//!    argument trivial but meant any way of losing a mark produced a STALE
//!    VALUE. It lived in `GcHeader::_reserved` bit 13 — which
//!    `layout::set_layout_state` CLEARS on transitions that have nothing to do
//!    with prototypes, so marks were erasable and the failure was invisible.
//!    Both halves of that are fixed here: the flag moved to `ObjectMeta`,
//!    where nothing else writes it, and the prime no longer records through a
//!    hop it marked in the same breath.
//! 2. Any STRUCTURAL mutation of a marked object bumps [`proto_validity`].
//!    Structural means "the shape word changed": key add, key delete,
//!    descriptor install, attribute change, `setPrototypeOf`. Every one of
//!    those publishes through
//!    `shapes::stamp_object_shape_id_with_carrier_note`, the runtime's single
//!    structural-mutation publication funnel, where [`note_object_shape_stamped`]
//!    sits.
//! 3. The same counter is bumped by `prop_plan::prop_plan_epoch_bump`, so it
//!    also stands for everything the semantic property epoch stands for
//!    (descriptor installs and clears, `delete`, per-instance prototype
//!    recording, class-prototype-object registration, parent-static linking).
//!    A descriptor install or clear, or a `delete`, bumps it only when its
//!    owner can be a hop of a recorded chain — a MARKED ordinary object, or
//!    one that cannot be classified ([`mutation_owner_may_be_a_recorded_hop`]).
//!    Every consumer records through marked hops only, and the receiver's own
//!    such mutations transition its ShapeId, so an unmarked object's
//!    descriptors cannot change a recorded answer. Without that gate every
//!    `Function.prototype.bind` (which names its result through descriptor
//!    installs) invalidated every cached verdict in the process. Folding the two
//!    into one word is what lets a cached entry re-prove itself with ONE load
//!    and ONE compare instead of two of each.
//!
//! A plain value store to an existing key deliberately does NOT invalidate: a
//! cache entry records (holder, slot) and LOADS the value on every hit, so a
//! new value is seen without any invalidation at all.
//!
//! # Why the counter is global, and what that costs
//!
//! Per-prototype validity would need a word per prototype object and a load of
//! it per hop — which is the per-hop walk again, one indirection shallower. A
//! single global word is one load, covers a chain of ANY depth, and is the
//! only form an emitted inline check can use.
//!
//! What it buys in over-invalidation is real but small, because the bump is
//! gated on the mark: mutating an ordinary object — the overwhelming majority
//! of all mutation — bumps nothing. Only mutating an object that something
//! actually inherits from does, and then it invalidates every cached inherited
//! read rather than the ones that name it. Measured (`/root/pv`, one
//! structural mutation of an UNRELATED prototype per 64 inherited reads, which
//! a per-prototype design would not invalidate at all): see the PR body.
//!
//! # Cost when nothing is marked
//!
//! [`note_object_shape_stamped`] is on the structural-mutation path, which a
//! program that builds objects in a loop runs hot. Until something is marked
//! it is one relaxed `bool` load and a predictable not-taken branch: the
//! latch is only ever set by a prime of the inherited-read cache, so a program
//! with no inherited reads never pays the header load.
