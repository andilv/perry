//! The method-call site memo: `recv.m(args)` on the One Path.
//!
//! A method call is a property read followed by a call. The emitted site
//! (`perry-codegen/src/expr/method_site.rs`) compares the receiver's
//! `(class_id | ShapeId)` word against each entry's [`MethodEntry::word`] and
//! then, with no runtime call:
//!
//! * **own entry** — loads the receiver's inline slot [`MethodEntry::slot`],
//!   proves the value is a closure whose body info equals
//!   [`MethodEntry::info`], and calls [`MethodEntry::code`] directly with the
//!   receiver as `this`;
//! * **inherited entry** ([`METHOD_SITE_INHERITED`] in `slot`) — compares the
//!   direct holder's word with [`MethodEntry::gen`], loads its slot, proves
//!   the loaded closure has [`MethodEntry::info`], and calls it directly.
//! * **ConstFn entry** ([`METHOD_SITE_CONSTFN`], own or inherited) — the
//!   compared shape (the receiver's, or for an inherited entry the holder's)
//!   carries a ConstFn lane for the slot, so the slot holds a closure of the
//!   recorded body: the hit loads it only as the callee environment and calls
//!   [`MethodEntry::code`] with exactly the call's arguments, with no kind or
//!   info check. Primed only for a body declaring at most the call's argument
//!   count (a body that wants `undefined` padding keeps a plain entry).
//!
//! Everything else calls [`js_method_site_miss`], which primes the entry when
//! the facts below hold and then performs the ordinary dispatch.
//!
//! # What an entry claims, and why it cannot go stale
//!
//! The memo holds facts of ONE shape, validated on every use:
//!
//! * A ShapeId names one immutable key list, one descriptor state and one
//!   [[Prototype]] (#11342). So "`m` is an own inline data property at slot
//!   `s`" and "`m` is absent from the receiver" are facts of the ShapeId: a
//!   shadowing own property, a descriptor, a delete or a prototype change
//!   re-stamps the receiver and the word stops matching.
//! * An own entry re-loads the slot on every call and compares the value's
//!   code pointer, so a reassigned method (`o.m = other`, no shape change) is
//!   seen at once. The body info, not the closure, is compared: a factory
//!   that returns fresh closures per object shares one body, and the call
//!   passes the LOADED closure, so each object's captures are its own.
//! * An inherited entry holds the direct holder as a strong root. The
//!   receiver's shape pins that holder, and the holder's shape pins the
//!   inline slot. A structural change invalidates one of those word compares;
//!   a value overwrite is seen by loading the slot on every hit.
//!
//! What the prime refuses (they keep the ordinary dispatch): non-ordinary
//! receivers (class objects, native-module namespaces, dictionaries,
//! `Object.prototype`, typed-array prototypes, exotic read receivers),
//! accessors, spill slots, class instances for the inherited entry (their
//! methods live in the vtable until class prototypes carry real slots, D4),
//! and any value that is not a plain closure the call can enter directly for
//! this site's argument count (bound functions, rest / `arguments` bodies,
//! runtime thunks, class constructors, closures that capture `this`).
//!
//! # The one site-memo module (shared)
//!
//! This is THE per-site memo for "the receiver's shape answers this key":
//! method calls use it today, and class accessors (step 3, S4) add their
//! entry kind here rather than growing a second table. The contract every
//! entry kind keeps:
//!
//! * an entry is facts of ONE receiver word (`class_id | ShapeId`), compared
//!   by the emitted code on every use; nothing is keyed on a class id, an
//!   address or a name alone;
//! * the kind lives in the top bits of [`MethodEntry::slot`]: `0` own inline,
//!   bit 63 inherited ([`METHOD_SITE_INHERITED`]), bit 62 own spill
//!   ([`METHOD_SITE_SPILL`]), bit 61 own function-bag
//!   ([`METHOD_SITE_FUNCTION_BAG`]: a function-object receiver whose method is
//!   an inline slot of its own-property object); bit 60 is RESERVED for the
//!   accessor kind. A new kind extends the emitted `msite.other` dispatch and
//!   [`publish`], nothing else;
//! * an entry that holds a heap reference stores it in [`MethodEntry::closure`]
//!   and is registered by [`publish`], so [`scan_method_site_roots_mut`] marks
//!   and rewrites it;
//! * an inherited entry records the direct holder's word in
//!   [`MethodEntry::gen`]; deeper chains stay on ordinary dispatch;
//! * primes run after the ordinary dispatch, with collection suppressed.
//!
//! # GC
//!
//! [`MethodEntry::closure`] is a STRONG root for the inherited holder: marked,
//! and rewritten when it moves (`scan_method_site_roots_mut`). Every site that ever primed an
//! inherited entry is registered once for the scan.
//!
//! # Agents
//!
//! The first worker start atomically gates every emitted method site and
//! prevents further primes. It does not rewrite a live site while primary
//! code may be reading it. Existing inherited entries are no longer read or
//! traced by any agent after the gate; their stale words are inert and the
//! holders can be collected by the primary GC. The cost thereafter is
//! ordinary method dispatch at every site.
