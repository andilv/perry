//! A store SITE's proof that `[[Set]]` of its key on a class instance creates
//! an own data property — so the next store of the same key on the same kind
//! of receiver can take the shape-transition append directly.
//!
//! # The cost this removes
//!
//! A store that ADDS a key (`this.pos = pos` in a constructor that declares no
//! fields; `this.parse = this.parse.bind(this)` shadowing an inherited method)
//! has to consult the prototype chain: an inherited setter would run instead,
//! and an inherited non-writable property would refuse the write. For a plain
//! object the runtime already skips that walk on a transition-cache hit
//! (`object_set_field_by_name_transition_fast_impl_value`), but it refuses
//! every CLASS instance ("a real user class must retain the full
//! inherited-setter/prototype walk"). So every key-adding store on a class
//! instance runs the full `[[Set]]` — receiver classification, key coercion,
//! the chain verdict, the own-overwrite probe, then the append: measured
//! ~5,600 instructions per store in tsc's `NodeObject` constructor shape, and
//! 1.27 M of them in one `transpileModule`.
//!
//! # What the site holds, and why it is not a copy of anyone's data
//!
//! One [`ChainStoreEntry`] per site, reached through the site's write cache
//! (word [`CHAIN_ENTRY_WORD`]; the emitted code never reads it). It records
//! the answer the authoritative predicate gave for ONE receiver kind:
//!
//! * `proto_id` — the prototype identity the receiver's SHAPE records
//!   (`shapes::object_proto_id`; [[Prototype]] is a shape fact). It names the
//!   chain the verdict was computed over and is read THROUGH the receiver's
//!   shape at hit time. The rest of the shape — the receiver's own layout —
//!   is deliberately not compared: whether the key is own is answered by the
//!   receiver's shape through its transition edge (`(shape, key)` exists
//!   only for a shape that lacks the key), so one entry serves a constructor
//!   site whose receiver changes shape at every statement while keeping its
//!   prototype.
//! * `key` — the interned key the verdict is about.
//! * `validity` / `vtable_gen` — the two words that move when anything the
//!   verdict read changes (below).
//!
//! It never decides anything alone: every use re-reads the receiver's shape,
//! header flags and the two words, and the append itself goes
//! through the transition lane, which re-validates the receiver's shape. A
//! mismatch falls through to the unchanged `[[Set]]`. Deleting every entry
//! costs only speed.
//!
//! # What the verdict depends on, and what invalidates it
//!
//! The verdict is exactly `!class_instance_set_may_intercept(obj, class_id,
//! key)` — the predicate `proxy::ordinary_set_with_receiver` already uses to
//! decide that a class-instance store is a plain `target_set`. Its inputs:
//!
//! 1. a class getter/setter for the key in the class chain
//!    (`class_chain_has_instance_accessor`) — registered in the vtable, so any
//!    change bumps `VTABLE_GEN` ([`ChainStoreEntry::vtable_gen`]);
//! 2. an accessor or non-writable data property for the key on any prototype
//!    OBJECT on the chain, including `Object.prototype` — a descriptor install
//!    or clear, which bumps the semantic property epoch, folded into
//!    `proto_validity` ([`ChainStoreEntry::validity`]);
//! 3. the chain itself: `setPrototypeOf` / `__proto__` anywhere (semantic
//!    epoch), class-prototype-object registration or replacement
//!    (`class_lookup_surface_gen_bump`, which bumps `proto_validity`), and a
//!    Proxy on the chain (the predicate refuses it, so no entry exists);
//! 4. the receiver's own [[Prototype]] — the `proto_id` its shape records,
//!    which every prototype change on the receiver transitions.
//!
//! Per-object facts are not part of the verdict and are re-checked on every
//! hit from the receiver's header and meta record: frozen / sealed /
//! non-extensible, a null `[[Prototype]]`, an `elements` store, the exotic-
//! receiver flag. An own descriptor on the receiver is re-checked per key by
//! the transition lane itself.
//!
//! # GC
//!
//! `key` is a heap reference. It is a STRONG root
//! (`scan_chain_store_roots_mut`): marked, so it cannot die and have its
//! address reused under an entry, and rewritten, so a move is followed. The
//! retention is bounded by the number of store sites that ever primed, and an
//! interned key is long-lived anyway. `proto_id` is a number, not a
//! reference.
//!
//! # Agents
//!
//! Site caches are process-global, but a heap reference belongs to one heap.
//! Entries are created and consulted only on [`crate::agent::PRIMARY_AGENT`];
//! a `perry/thread` worker takes the unchanged `[[Set]]`, so no worker ever
//! reads or writes a primary-heap reference through a site.
