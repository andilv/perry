//! Storage for the agent-local shape descriptor table (#9706).
//!
//! Two structures, both owned by [`super::ShapeTable`]:
//!
//! * [`ShapeSlab`] — the by-id store. A ShapeId is a process-global monotonic
//!   counter (`SHAPE_ID_BASE + n`), so `n` indexes a chunked slab directly: no
//!   hash, no per-record heap allocation, and a record address that never
//!   moves for the record's lifetime — the property the collector relies on
//!   when it enumerates a descriptor's `keys` word as a rewritable slot
//!   (#8112) and retains that address across budgeted resumptions. Chunks
//!   (32 records) hang off a two-level page directory, are allocated lazily
//!   (a worker's ids interleave with the main thread's), and an all-dead chunk
//!   is released by [`ShapeSlab::release_empty_chunks`] at the same cadence as
//!   the reverse-index shrink (once per major collection).
//!
//! * [`IdList`] — the value of the per-keys-address family index
//!   (`ShapeTableInner::families`). One entry per keys array names every
//!   descriptor id currently indexed under that address. Exact-facts interning
//!   walks the family and compares the remaining facts against the slab
//!   record, which is what lets the table drop the second, facts-keyed reverse
//!   map it used to carry: a family is small by construction — a SHARED keys
//!   array is immutable, so its descriptors differ only in the birth bound or
//!   a semantic generation, and an OWNED array retires its growth history
//!   eagerly (`retire_owned_shape_siblings`).
//!
//! Measured on the compiled claude-code TUI at idle (`PERRY_GC_CENSUS`), the
//! previous layout — a `PtrHashMap<u32, Box<ShapeDescriptor>>` beside two
//! `Vec<u32>`-valued reverse maps — cost ~330 bytes per live descriptor:
//! a 56-byte record in a 64-byte allocator bin, a 16-byte map entry at 25%
//! load after `shrink_to(2 * len)`, a 57-byte facts-map bucket, and a 33-byte
//! keys-map bucket, plus a 16-byte `Vec` buffer per reverse entry. A packed
//! 32-byte slab record with one 24-byte family bucket per keys array is the
//! same information at a fraction of the bytes.
