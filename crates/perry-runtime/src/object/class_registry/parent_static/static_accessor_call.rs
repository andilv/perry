/// #10893 — `C.g(args)` where `g` is a static ACCESSOR reached through the
/// class-id parent chain.
///
/// `C.g(args)` is `Get(C, "g")` followed by a call, so a static getter whose
/// value is callable has to be READ and then invoked.
/// `js_class_static_method_call` resolves `name` against the static-method,
/// static-field, native-proto, constructor-prototype, Promise, Array-subclass
/// and parent-closure tables; none of them holds a class-body `static get`,
/// which lives in `CLASS_STATIC_ACCESSORS`.
///
/// Codegen has its own accessor interception
/// (`try_lower_class_static_accessor_call`), but it keys on the STATIC
/// `extends_name` chain, so an accessor declared on a parent reached through a
/// runtime-resolved heritage (`class G extends make() {}`) is invisible to it.
/// The class-id parent chain is the only place that edge exists, which is why
/// the fix belongs at this layer. A codegen-side "this class has a dynamic
/// parent, so read-then-call instead" guess cannot work: it cannot know whether
/// the runtime parent actually carries the accessor, and diverting on the guess
/// loses every inherited builtin static the arms below serve.
/// `class MyArr extends Array {}` is exactly that trap — `extends Array` lowers
/// to a DYNAMIC parent (`Array` is not a user class, so `lookup_class` misses
/// and `extends_expr` is captured), so such a guess also swallows
/// `MyArr.from(...)` / `.of(...)` / `.isArray(...)` (#7541), whose property-GET
/// form is still `undefined`.
///
/// The read itself goes through `js_object_get_field_by_name_f64` — the SAME
/// entry point codegen emits for `const f = C.g` — rather than calling
/// `class_static_accessor_getter_value` directly. That matters: the getter is
/// found on an ANCESTOR, and its captures (`__perry_ctor_caps`) live on the
/// per-evaluation parent class OBJECT, not on the subclass the call started
/// from. Passing the subclass straight to the accessor helper makes it the
/// capture/private OWNER and the getter body then reads `undefined` for every
/// captured binding (#10893's own `cache` Map). The GET path resolves the owner
/// through the static-prototype chain and stashes the original receiver as the
/// accessor-receiver override, so `this` is still the subclass; reusing it
/// keeps both halves right by construction.
///
/// Returns `None` when no accessor of that name is on the chain, or when its
/// value is not callable — both leave the caller's remaining arms intact.
///
/// The getter body is user JS and can collect, so the caller's argument buffer
/// (a raw pointer into a caller-side alloca the collector does not rewrite) is
/// rooted across it and re-read afterwards, as are the receiver and the key.
