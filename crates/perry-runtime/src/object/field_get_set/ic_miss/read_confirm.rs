//! First-read D3: everything a generic read site's miss can answer WITHOUT
//! collecting, in one GC-leaf call.
//!
//! Emitted code keeps exactly one thing inline for a read: the receiver's
//! ShapeId compared against the site's compact word, and the slot load. A
//! ShapeId miss makes ONE call to [`js_object_get_field_ic_front`], which
//! answers, in this order and only from shape facts:
//!
//! 1. a polymorphic way (#7753): `(ShapeId token, slot)` pairs in the site's
//!    full cache;
//! 2. a SPILL entry: the compact word holds the receiver's ShapeId flipped by
//!    `PACKED_SPILL_FLIP`; the ShapeId fixes the key's index in the spill
//!    buffer (`packed_get::prime_get`, `spill_reserve_claimed`);
//! 3. a LATCHED megamorphic site (way state negative): its slot guess (the
//!    compact word's high half), confirmed by the receiver's own shape — the
//!    shape record's `POSBOUND` and its canonical key list compared with the
//!    key atom — and, on a wrong guess, one bounded scan of that key list that
//!    re-aims the guess (D3b);
//! 4. the site's HOLDER entry (`method_site::read_holder`): a key that is not
//!    own, answered from the receiver's shape and the holder's.
//!
//! Anything else answers `TAG_HOLE`, and only then does the site branch to
//! its cold block and call the collecting `js_object_get_field_ic_slow` with
//! its usual operands (a never-primed site's inherited-read cache is asked
//! there). The front never allocates, collects, enters JS, throws, takes a
//! lock or makes a call — not even a thread-local access: the site passes the
//! agent's shape-directory mirror (`PERRY_AGENT_PTRS` slot 0, never null) as
//! an operand.
//! It is therefore `Leaf` in the generated call-effects table, the site's call
//! is a plain `"gc-leaf-function"` call, and nothing live across it is
//! spilled or relocated: statepoint spills exist only on the cold slow edge.
