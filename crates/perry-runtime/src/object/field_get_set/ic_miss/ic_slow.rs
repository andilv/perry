//! The two slow exits of the emitted generic property-get tower.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `lower_generic_property_get` used to emit ~37 basic blocks and 6-7 runtime
//! call sites per untyped `obj.prop`: an SSO arm, an INT32 class-ref arm, a
//! nullish-throw arm, a non-object-receiver arm, an overflow-slot load, a
//! deleted-slot miss, two Array-subclass named-prefix ladders, and the
//! miss+prime. Every one of those calls is a statepoint, so both the emitted
//! `.text` and `.perry_gcmap` scale with call sites x live GC values — on
//! @babel/parser that tower was 29% of all emitted IR over 6,487 sites.
//!
//! The inline *hit* is worth its bytes; the arms around it are not. These two
//! entries are what the site branches to instead of each of them, reproducing
//! the arms they replaced in the same ORDER and with the same cache-priming
//! decisions. The emitted site keeps, byte for byte, the receiver-tag test, the
//! small-handle test, the packed header kind/descriptor test, the packed-MRU
//! compare, the overflow-bit test, the inline field load with its hole check,
//! and the polymorphic ways.
//!
//! # Why TWO exits and not one
//!
//! The first cut had one entry taking the unmasked NaN-box, reached from every
//! guard failure including the receiver-tag test. It cost **+4.00 instructions
//! on every property-read HIT**, measured on a monomorphic 10M-read loop
//! (1,231,521,261 -> 1,271,522,669 retired instructions, +3.2%), and the
//! disassembly says exactly why: with the tag test and the small-handle test
//! failing to the SAME block, LLVM's SimplifyCFG folds them into one flat
//! predicate —
//!
//! ```text
//!   cmp …; sete %dl; cmp …; setae %dil; test %dil,%dl; je   (6 instructions)
//! ```
//!
//! — where the branchy chain was `cmp; jne; cmp; ja` (4). That is #7883's
//! finding re-introduced from the other side: there codegen flattened the
//! guards, here the optimiser does it because the shared exit made the two
//! branches congruent. Giving the tag test its own callee restores the chain
//! (and, as a bonus, lets the unmasked `obj_bits` die in the entry block
//! instead of staying live across the whole hit path for a call it might make).
//!
//! The split is along the one line that matters: [`js_object_get_field_ic_nonptr`]
//! serves receivers that are NOT heap pointers (and needs the tag, not the
//! cache), [`js_object_get_field_ic_slow`] serves the ones that are (and needs
//! the cache, not the tag). Two call sites per site instead of six.
//!
//! # The arms, in the order the emitted tower took them
//!
//! 1. Receiver-tag routing ([`js_object_get_field_ic_nonptr`]), exactly as
//!    `js_object_get_field_ic` does it (SSO -> the SSO-aware by-name helper;
//!    INT32 class ref -> the feedback-wrapped by-name helper; nullish ->
//!    `TypeError`; any other non-pointer -> the by-name helper, which still
//!    resolves typed shapes such as Date `.constructor`).
//! 2. A packed-MRU token HIT that the emitted hit path declined:
//!    * the slot carries `IC_SLOT_OVERFLOW_BIT` — the field lives in the spill
//!      buffer, so the inline `obj + header + slot*8` arithmetic must not run
//!      on it. This is `js_object_get_field_ic_overflow_load`'s body, including
//!      its fallback to the miss handler **without** the packed republication
//!      (that helper called the three-argument `js_object_get_field_ic_miss`,
//!      and re-publishing the packed word here would change which arm the next
//!      read of the same site takes);
//!    * otherwise the inline load found `TAG_HOLE` — a field deleted since
//!      priming — and takes the ordinary miss, with the packed word, exactly
//!      as the emitted `pic.hit.deleted` -> `pic.miss.call` edge did.
//! 3. The Array-subclass named-prefix proof (cache word 2 against `ObjectMeta`
//!    word 6, then the cached slot). The emitted tower had this twice, once for
//!    a descriptor-free receiver whose exact ShapeId missed and once for a
//!    descriptor-bearing one that could never take the raw-load PIC at all;
//!    both reduce to the same three loads on a `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` receiver with a
//!    resolved cache, so they are one arm here.
//! 4. Everything else: `get_field_ic_miss_impl`, which owns the priming policy
//!    (`prime_get`, the megamorphic countdown, the `PERRY_IC_DIAG` rows).
//!
//! # What is deliberately NOT here
//!
//! The polymorphic ways stay inline. They are read-only compares against a
//! cache the site already resolved, they serve the receiver rotation that is
//! the whole point of #7753, and moving them behind a call is a separate
//! measurement.
//!
//! Typed feedback is unchanged: the OBSERVE call still sits inline in
//! `pget.recv_ok` and the guard-pass / guard-fail / fallback-call records still
//! sit on the emitted edges, all under the same compile-time gate. The one
//! feedback call that lives here is the class-ref arm's, which was a
//! feedback-wrapped helper on that edge before and still is.
//!
//! # Rooting
//!
//! Every call these functions make is in TAIL position: the tag-routing arms,
//! the overflow fallback, and `get_field_ic_miss_impl` are all `return`s, and
//! the two probes above them (`overflow_get`, the named-prefix loads) neither
//! allocate nor enter user code. There is therefore no window in which a raw
//! `obj`/`key` argument is named after a collection point, which is the
//! condition a `RuntimeHandleScope` exists to cover (cf. `js_put_value_set_ic_miss`,
//! which re-reads its key to prime AFTER the allocating `js_put_value_set`).
//! Adding a scope here would root nothing and would put a TLS push/pop on every
//! megamorphic read. If an arm ever grows work after a call, it needs the scope
//! at that moment.
