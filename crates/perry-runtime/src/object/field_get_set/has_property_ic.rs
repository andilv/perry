//! Presence inline cache for `"k" in o` with a **constant** key.
//!
//! `in` has no cache slot today: every `"k" in o` is a bare `js_in_operator`
//! call that re-derives the receiver's keys array from its ShapeId (a shape
//! slab probe) and re-scans it, ~950 instructions for a hit on a plain object.
//! The answer it recomputes is a property of the *shape*, not of the object:
//! two objects with the same ShapeId have the same keys array, so "shape S has
//! own key K" is stable for as long as S is stamped on the receiver.
//!
//! So the site caches exactly that — one ShapeId — and the emitted guard
//! answers `true` when the receiver still carries it. Everything else calls
//! [`js_in_operator_presence_ic`], which computes the real answer and may arm
//! the site.
//!
//! # Why only positives, and why no prototype epoch is needed
//!
//! The cached claim is about an **own** key, so it does not mention the
//! prototype chain: `Object.setPrototypeOf`, a late `Proto.x = 1`, a
//! `delete Proto.x` — none of them can make an own key stop existing, so none
//! of them can invalidate a positive. A *negative* would be a claim about the
//! whole chain, and there is no prototype-chain epoch in this runtime to key
//! one on (`prototype_chain` records per-object replacements; nothing counts
//! chain mutations globally), so negatives are not cached at all — `"zz" in o`
//! keeps calling the runtime every time.
//!
//! # What invalidates a positive
//!
//! Only losing the key, and every way of losing it moves the receiver off the
//! cached ShapeId or off the guard:
//!
//! * A compacting `delete` rebuilds the keys array and publishes a new
//!   ShapeId — the stamp at header offset 4 no longer matches.
//! * A tombstoning `delete` (#9064) deliberately KEEPS the ShapeId and leaves
//!   `TAG_HOLE` in the slot, but it sets `OBJ_FLAG_STABLE_TOMBSTONES` on the
//!   receiver in the same step; the emitted guard rejects that bit, so such a
//!   receiver never takes the inline answer again.
//! * Adding a key is a transition to a different ShapeId, which can only turn
//!   a hit into a miss (`true` stays `true` for the cached key anyway).
//! * A moved receiver reads its own header, so evacuation is invisible here;
//!   a forwarded one is rejected by the guard's `GC_FLAG_FORWARDED` test.
//!
//! ShapeIds are allocated monotonically from a process-global counter and are
//! never reused (`shapes::SHAPE_ID_NEXT`), so a stale stamp can only miss. The
//! id range (`0x8000_0000..0xC000_0000`) is disjoint from every class id, so
//! the guard's compare against a header word that still holds
//! `parent_class_id` — an object that was never shape-stamped — cannot alias
//! an armed id either.
//!
//! The cache holds two integers and never a pointer, so it is not a GC root
//! (contrast the caches enumerated by `scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py`).
