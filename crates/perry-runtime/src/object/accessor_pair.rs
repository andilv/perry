//! Charter step 3, accessor stage: an accessor property's getter/setter pair
//! lives in the VALUE SLOT of the key on the object that owns it (V8's
//! `AccessorPair`), not in an address-keyed side table.
//!
//! The key's attribute entry (`key_attrs.rs`) says the key is an accessor;
//! the slot says which functions. So a read that resolves to an accessor on
//! a prototype is: compare the receiver's ShapeId, load the holder's slot,
//! call the getter — the shape proves the entry, the slot names the function.
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! A pair is a small runtime-internal `GC_TYPE_ARRAY` of [`PAIR_LEN`] words:
//!
//! | word | holds |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`PAIR_GET`] | the getter as a NaN-boxed closure, or `undefined` |
//! | [`PAIR_SET`] | the setter as a NaN-boxed closure, or `undefined` |
//! | [`PAIR_RAW_GET`] | a class getter's compiled entry (its address bits, see below), or 0 |
//! | [`PAIR_RAW_SET`] | a class setter's compiled entry (its address bits, see below), or 0 |
//!
//! A compiled entry has one of two calling conventions, and the word says
//! which. An INSTANCE accessor's entry takes the receiver as a parameter
//! (`fn(this) -> value` / `fn(this, v)`); its word is the bare address. A
//! STATIC accessor's entry (a ClassBody `static get`/`static set`, installed
//! on the class function object) takes no receiver (`fn() -> value` /
//! `fn(v)`, `this` armed by the caller); its word carries
//! [`STATIC_ENTRY_BIT`] above the address. Decoding splits the two into
//! different [`Accessor`] fields, so a reader that calls with the receiver
//! as a parameter (`raw_get`/`raw_set`) is never handed a static entry.
//!
//! The two closure words are ordinary traced slots. The raw entries are code
//! addresses stored as their plain bits: an address below 2^48 has none of the
//! NaN-box tag bits set, so the collector reads the word as a (subnormal) JS
//! Number and never follows it, and a cache hit uses it without conversion. A class accessor keeps both forms: the closure is what
//! reflection hands out (`getOwnPropertyDescriptor(C.prototype, k).get`), the
//! raw entry is what an inline cache calls with the receiver as `this`.
//!
//! A pair is NEVER a JS value. It is reachable only through a slot whose
//! key's entry carries `ENTRY_ACCESSOR`, and every reader of such a slot goes
//! through [`slot_accessor`]; a raw slot reader that has not asked the key's
//! entry must treat an accessor key's slot as having no data value (see
//! `key_attrs::object_slot_data`).
