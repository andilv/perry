//! Charter step 3: a key's ATTRIBUTES live with the key, in the keys array
//! (V8's descriptor arrays).
//!
//! # Representation
//!
//! Every key position carries one *entry* byte. `0` is the default — a
//! writable, enumerable, configurable data property — so a list whose keys
//! are all default carries nothing, hashes and validates exactly as it did
//! before attributes existed, and costs a plain object nothing:
//!
//! | bit | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`ENTRY_NON_WRITABLE`] | `[[Writable]]` false (for an accessor: the internal writable bit) |
//! | [`ENTRY_NON_ENUMERABLE`] | `[[Enumerable]]` false |
//! | [`ENTRY_NON_CONFIGURABLE`] | `[[Configurable]]` false |
//! | [`ENTRY_ACCESSOR`] | an accessor property |
//! | [`ENTRY_HAS_GET`] / [`ENTRY_HAS_SET`] | which accessor halves exist |
//!
//! A keys array that carries any non-default entry owns an *attributes
//! array*: a pointer-free `GC_TYPE_ARRAY` with one element per key position,
//! `INT32_TAG | cumulative << 8 | entry`. `cumulative` is the OR of
//! [`entry_summary`] over positions `0..=i`, so the summary of any PREFIX of
//! the list — which is what a shape names, since one canonical backing serves
//! a whole growth chain (`canonical_keys.rs`) — is one load:
//! [`keys_summary`]`(keys, count)`.
//!
//! The pointer to the attributes array lives in the keys array's first
//! physical slot, in front of logical element 0, with `GC_ARRAY_NAMED_PROPS`
//! set: exactly the reserve #10166 gives an Array's named properties
//! (`array/named_props.rs`). So nothing new exists for the collector: the
//! reserve word is already emitted as a fixed child slot of every flagged
//! array (`gc::layout_slot_visit`), `js_array_grow` already re-reserves and
//! copies it, and every element reader already adds the front offset
//! (`array_elements_ptr`, #10939). The front slot count is
//! [`KEYS_ATTRS_FRONT_SLOTS`]; nothing may hand-type it.
//!
//! # Why reusing `GC_ARRAY_NAMED_PROPS` on a keys array is sound
//!
//! `GcHeader::_reserved` has no free bit for arrays (`gc/types.rs`). The
//! named-properties bit means "the first physical slot is a traced reserve
//! word" to the collector and to growth, and that is all a keys array needs.
//! Its other meaning — "this Array has expando properties, read them from a
//! pairs array" — is consulted only by the JS-facing Array operations
//! (`arr.foo`, `Object.keys(arr)`, …), and a keys array is NEVER a JS value:
//! it is reached only through a shape record or a dictionary receiver's meta
//! record, and every producer that hands keys to JS (`Object.keys`,
//! `getOwnPropertyNames`, `for…in`) builds a fresh result array. A keys
//! array therefore never meets a reader of the pairs interpretation.
//!
//! # Mutability follows the keys
//!
//! A canonical backing's attributes prefix is as immutable as its key prefix:
//! the only in-place write is the tip append past every published count. An
//! owned list (a dictionary receiver's private list) is mutated in place with
//! its keys; its cumulative words are then recomputed from the edited
//! position, so they stay exact.
