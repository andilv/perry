///
/// 1. **The key-add must reuse the first receiver's edge.** A ShapeId's
///    identity includes the keys ARRAY ADDRESS, and two objects share one only
///    when the second's key-add hits `object::transition_cache_lookup` — a
///    16384-entry DIRECT-MAPPED table hashed on `(predecessor ShapeId, the
///    interned key's address)`. A collision from an unrelated entry evicts the
///    edge, the second receiver mints its own keys array and its own ShapeId,
///    and nothing is wrong: a transition-cache miss costs a duplicate shape,
///    never a wrong answer. But it is address-keyed, so whether it collides
///    varies with heap placement RUN TO RUN. With an unrelated call between
///    the two `set`s this test failed 2 runs in 6 of the same binary. Both
///    key-adds therefore happen back to back, with only an allocation between
///    them, so the edge the first one inserts is certain to still be there.
/// 2. **Both prototype links must precede the prime.** `Object.setPrototypeOf`
///    is a semantic property event: it bumps `prop_plan_epoch`, which bumps the
///    one validity word every entry is re-proved against
///    (`object::proto_validity`, check 1). Linking `second` AFTER priming
///    `first` retires the entry that was just made. Measured, every other field
///    of the entry matched the second receiver exactly — same class id `0x0`,
///    same ShapeId, same recorded prototype bits, same slot index — and only
///    `validity` differed, by one. The miss that followed said nothing
///    whatever about entry sharing.
///
/// The ShapeId merge is then asserted rather than assumed. #10931 mints a
/// prototype divergence's generation as a pure function of `(predecessor
/// ShapeId, the prototype's stable serial, link kind)`, so with (1) holding,
/// these two land on ONE ShapeId. Before it, each drew a fresh value from the
/// monotonic counter and they never could, which is why this test was written
/// with an `if (*first).parent_class_id == (*second).parent_class_id` guard
/// around its assertion. That word IS the ShapeId
/// ([`shapes::object_shape_stamp`] reads it), the two were never equal, and the
/// body never ran: the test was dormant from the day it was written. It is an
/// assertion now, so it can never go quiet again.
