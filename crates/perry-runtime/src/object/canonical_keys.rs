//! Canonical keys arrays: the ADDRESS is the content identity (#10868 step
//! 2.5 stage 1b).
//!
//! `facts_key` folds SIX identity facts and one of them is the keys array's
//! ADDRESS. Two objects whose ordered key lists are byte-identical but whose
//! arrays were allocated separately therefore mint two ShapeIds for one
//! layout. On a real `ts.transpileModule` that is 32,246 of 42,097 mints
//! (`key_count` 19,923 plus `fresh_keys_known_list` 12,323) against a process
//! that ABORTS when the id space runs out.
//!
//! The fix is not to change `facts_key`. It is to make the address tell the
//! truth: obtain every keys array from here and exactly one array exists per
//! distinct ordered key list, so folding the pointer IS folding the content,
//! and the probe path stays byte-for-byte what it was.
//!
//! ## The structure is a TRIE, so `extend_slot` is O(1) and no content is hashed
//!
//! L8.3.15 named the one hard problem: `facts_key` is O(1) because it folds a
//! pointer, and content is O(N). A content-hash intern table moves that O(N)
//! off the probe path onto array creation — better, but still O(N) per grow
//! and O(N^2) to build an N-key object one key at a time.
//!
//! Canonical arrays form a TREE. Every one of them is (canonical parent, one
//! appended slot), rooted at the empty list. So the table is an EDGE map, not
//! a content map; [`extend_slot`] is one hash probe on `(parent node, slot hash)`
//! plus an exact check of the single appended slot; and no content is ever
//! walked on a grow hit. [`canonicalize`] walks the same edges for a whole
//! list, but materializes only the requested leaf. Unpublished prefixes use
//! a weak descendant witness for exact slot validation.
//!
//! ## One BACKING per growth chain (V8's descriptor-array sharing)
//!
//! The lists on a linear chain — `[a]`, `[a,b]`, `[a,b,c]` — are prefixes of
//! each other, so they share ONE backing array that holds the tip's keys. A
//! node is `(backing, count)`: `[a,b]` is "the first two entries of that
//! backing". Extending the tip by one key appends in place ([`extend_slot`]):
//! amortized growth, no copy, no new array. A FORK — a different key appended
//! to a node the backing has already grown past — copies that node's prefix
//! into a new backing and continues there, as does a tip whose backing is
//! full.
//!
//! What makes this sound:
//! * the SHAPE owns the count. A descriptor is `(keys, logical_key_count)`,
//!   and every consumer reads an object's keys through
//!   [`crate::object::ObjectKeys`], which has no way to read past its count.
//!   A backing's header `length` is the tip's count and nobody else's;
//! * a backing's prefix is immutable. The only in-place write to a backing
//!   is this module's tip append, past every published count. Every other
//!   writer refuses a `GC_FLAG_SHAPE_SHARED` array and copies first, and every
//!   backing carries that flag from birth;
//! * the collector sees one ordinary array: its header length covers every
//!   written slot, it is traced and moved as a whole, and nodes and
//!   descriptors hold `(backing, count)` — never an interior pointer. A key
//!   string that moves is rewritten in the backing once, which is the right
//!   answer for every list sharing it: they name the same key.
//!
//! ## Node ids, not addresses, so the collector touches one `Vec`
//!
//! Edges are keyed by NODE ID, which the collector cannot move. Only
//! `Node::addr` and the address index are address-typed, so a minor visits a
//! contiguous `Vec<Node>` and patches a handful of index entries, instead of
//! rekeying an address-keyed edge map the way `move_shape_family` must rekey
//! `families`.
//!
//! ## Weak, exactly like the transition cache — and that is what bounds it
//!
//! #6759 phase 3 made the transition cache's `next_keys` WEAK (rewritten on
//! move, dropped on death) after strong rooting pinned up to 16,384 keys
//! arrays and, through them, their descriptors: 786k descriptors on a
//! workload holding under 400 live objects. This table is weak for the same
//! reason, through the same two mechanisms — [`scan_canonical_keys_roots_mut`]
//! and [`prune_dead_canonical_keys`].
//!
//! That answers L8.3.15c's retention worry, which assumed the intern table
//! would hold its arrays: **it holds none**. A node whose array died is
//! dropped, and retention is proportional to LIVE layouts. What the table
//! does supply is the dictionary latch's signal: a node's unique RUN, the keys
//! its lineage grew by one receiver's append at a time since another arrival
//! reached it ([`take_unique_run`]).
//!
//! Dropping a node whose array died can ORPHAN its children: they stay
//! adoptable and extendable, but a later walk from the root rebuilds the chain
//! and mints one duplicate layout. That is a mint, never a wrong answer, and
//! `fresh_keys_known_list` in the mint census is precisely its witness — which
//! is why the census, not a perf gate, is the acceptance instrument here.
