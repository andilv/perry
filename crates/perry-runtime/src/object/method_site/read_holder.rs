//! The read site's HOLDER entry: `o.k` where `k` is not an own key of the
//! receiver, answered by facts of two shapes.
//!
//! * The receiver's ShapeId `S` vouches that `k` is not own, that the receiver
//!   is an ordinary object, and its [[Prototype]] identity. Only a serial
//!   identity or `PROTO_ID_DEFAULT` (the realm's `Object.prototype`) pins ONE
//!   object, so only those admit.
//! * The holder's ShapeId `SH` vouches that `k` is an own inline data slot of
//!   the holder `H` — or, for an ABSENT entry, that the terminal object lacks
//!   `k` and has a null [[Prototype]].
//! * For a holder deeper than the direct prototype, each intermediate hop's
//!   ShapeId vouches that the hop lacks `k` and still links to the next hop.
//!
//! Every fact is compared on use, so there is no invalidation and no global
//! word: a key add, delete, descriptor change or `setPrototypeOf` on any object
//! the entry names moves that object's ShapeId, and a value store to the
//! holder's slot is seen because the hit LOADS the slot. A delete is a shape
//! transition (#10826), so a holder whose ShapeId matches still has the slot:
//! the hit needs no `TAG_HOLE` test, as the emitted MRU hit needs none.
//!
//! The entry lives in the read site's own cache (`PicCache` words
//! [`HOLDER_RECV`]..=[`HOLDER_REGISTERED`]). The holder and the hops are
//! STRONG roots, rewritten when they move ([`scan_read_holder_roots_mut`]).
//!
//! # Emitted form
//!
//! Emitted code holds nothing of the entry. The read site's ShapeId compare
//! misses, and its one GC-leaf front call
//! (`field_get_set::ic_miss::read_confirm::js_object_get_field_ic_front`)
//! asks [`entry_answer`] after the ways, the spill entry and a latched site's
//! confirm, so an own-key read pays nothing for it. A decline is `TAG_HOLE`
//! and the site continues to the collecting slow call.
//!
//! # Priming
//!
//! Only from the read miss handler, which already knows the key is not own,
//! and only after the generic getter has produced the answer: the entry is
//! recorded only when what the shapes say equals what the getter returned
//! (names the runtime synthesizes, lazily materialized intrinsics and
//! `constructor` refuse there). Primary agent only; a worker agent's start
//! empties every entry.
//!
//! A miss whose receiver the live entry already answers is served from the
//! entry and primes nothing (a caller that does not emit the check, such as
//! the class-field read's miss arm, reaches here on every read). A site that
//! refused once, or whose entry was replaced for a different receiver shape
//! [`MAX_REPRIMES`] times, is LATCHED in its own state word
//! ([`HOLDER_STATE`]): it never walks or primes again, and its misses take the
//! path they took before the entry existed.
