//! "Could this receiver own a property that shadows the builtin?" (#10943)
//!
//! # The bug this answers
//!
//! ECMA-262 resolves `recv.m(a)` as `Get(recv, "m")` then `Call`, so an own
//! `m` beats a builtin. perry lowers a method call to a DIRECT native call
//! (`js_map_get`, `js_date_*`, `js_array_*`, …) whenever it can prove the
//! receiver's KIND — and an own property that shadows the method leaves that
//! proof completely intact: `const m = new Map(); m.get = () => 1` is still
//! provably a Map. The result was a silent, PLAUSIBLE wrong value: a
//! zero-argument `Map.prototype.get` returns `undefined`, `RegExp.test` a
//! boolean, `Date.getTime` a number. Nothing throws.
//!
//! #10476 fixed the same bug for UNPROVEN receivers — their runtime kind
//! picks the builtin or the universal dispatcher, "which finds an own or
//! inherited user method". **A proof of KIND was being treated as a proof of
//! NO OWN OVERRIDE.** This module supplies the missing half of the condition.
//!
//! # Shape of the answer
//!
//! [`js_receiver_may_own_named_method`] is the condition of a diamond the
//! caller emits: false takes the direct builtin call, true takes the
//! universal method dispatcher. It only ever CHOOSES A BRANCH. It does not
//! resolve the property and call it — an own slot can hold a builtin thunk
//! that dispatches by name again, and an earlier attempt at this fix did
//! exactly that and overflowed the stack on
//! `test_bound_timer_dispatch_roots_args_during_async_hook_init_gc`. A
//! fail-closed answer may decline a fast path; it may not substitute an
//! action of its own.
//!
//! # Why a global flag rather than a per-cell bit
//!
//! `GcHeader::_reserved` has **no free bits** (`gc/types.rs`'s bit map says so
//! outright, and bits 12/13 are actively ERASED by `set_layout_state` —
//! #8690 and #10842 both lost a flag there). Arrays already carry
//! `GC_ARRAY_NAMED_PROPS`, but Map/Set/Date/RegExp keep their own named
//! properties in a per-thread side table, so there is no per-cell bit to read
//! and their `ObjectMeta` is usually null — asking there would mean
//! MATERIALISING a record to read an almost-always-clear flag.
//!
//! So the first question is process-global: *has any non-`ObjectHeader` cell
//! anywhere ever taken a named property?* Overwhelmingly the answer is no and
//! the cost is one relaxed load. This is the `accessors_in_use` idiom the read
//! path already uses.
//!
//! The flag is **set-only and over-approximating**, both deliberately. Set-only
//! because clearing it on delete would reopen the hole for
//! delete-then-shadow, exactly as `GC_ARRAY_NAMED_PROPS` is monotonic. Over-
//! approximating because it is armed at the TOP of the exotic-store gauntlet,
//! before that gauntlet's per-kind branches (buffer table, stream table, the
//! meta/expando paths): there is no single install funnel, and a missed
//! installer is the same silent wrong value this module exists to remove.
//! Arming early covers every kind, including ones added later, and the only
//! cost of a spurious arm is that the diamond's slow side runs.
