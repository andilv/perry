//! Inherited-read cache: `(receiver shape, key) -> (holder, inline slot)`.
//!
//! # The hole this fills
//!
//! Every property inline cache in Perry serves OWN data properties only. A
//! read whose key lives on the prototype chain therefore misses every cache
//! and re-runs the whole generic getter, which walks the chain from scratch on
//! every read. Callgrind on `const P={a:1}; const O=Object.create(P); O.a` (a
//! one-hop chain, perfectly monomorphic, v0.5.1619, 200 k reads):
//!
//! | cost per read | instr |
//! |---|---|
//! | `native_get::try_data_get_bytes` self (the probe ladder) | 344 |
//! | `class_registry::prototype_objects::class_prototype_object` | 192 (118 of it SipHash) |
//! | `keys_find_slot_by_bytes_resolved` x2 (receiver keys, then holder keys) | 180 |
//! | `ic_miss::get_field_ic_miss_impl` self (the own-key search that must fail first) | 153 |
//! | `has_property::closure_dynamic_prop_by_key` | 90 |
//! | `shapes::shape_descriptor_by_id` | 70 |
//! | `is_anon_shape_class_id` / `class_decl_prototype_object` / `from_utf8` / `is_arguments_object` | 161 |
//! | total | ~1300 |
//!
//! node and bun both serve the same read for the same price as an own read
//! (measured: 16.2 vs 16.0, and 14.2 vs 13.3). Nothing in that 1300 is a
//! prototype MUTEX or an address-keyed prototype probe — `OBJECT_PROTOTYPES`
//! never appears in the profile, because #6759 phase B already moved shaped
//! objects onto `ObjectMeta.prototype`. The cost is the walk itself being
//! redone, plus a SipHash class-registry probe per read to find the prototype
//! of an `Object.create` receiver.
//!
//! # What an entry claims, and what makes the claim true
//!
//! An entry says: *a receiver whose (class id, ShapeId, recorded prototype
//! bits) are these, reading this interned key, finds it as a plain inline data
//! slot `slot` on `hops[hop_count-1]`, having passed through `hops[0..]` in
//! order.*
//!
//! The claim is re-proved on every hit by all four checks below. The code
//! runs them cheapest-and-most-selective first, not in the order they are
//! listed:
//!
//! 1. `proto_validity::proto_validity()` is unchanged. ONE global word, ONE
//!    load, ONE compare, covering a chain of ANY depth. It stands for two
//!    things at once:
//!    * no object anybody inherits from has changed STRUCTURALLY. An object
//!      is marked (`OBJ_FLAG_IS_PROTOTYPE`) when this cache records it as a
//!      hop, and every shape-word change on a marked object bumps the counter
//!      from the runtime's single structural-mutation publication funnel. A
//!      key ADDED to a prototype bumps no epoch — a plain store is not a
//!      descriptor install — and this is what sees it.
//!    * nothing the semantic property epoch stands for has happened:
//!      descriptor installs and clears, `delete`, per-instance prototype
//!      recording (`Object.setPrototypeOf`, `__proto__`),
//!      class-prototype-object registration, parent-static linking.
//!      `prop_plan_epoch_bump` bumps this word too. It is deliberately NOT
//!      bumped by GC, which is what keeps this cache off the #7910 cliff (the
//!      full `PROP_PLAN_EPOCH` is bumped at loop-poll cadence by the
//!      incremental collector, so keying on it degrades any cache into an
//!      unconditional recompute).
//!
//!    This REPLACED one ShapeId compare per hop. The per-hop walk was correct
//!    and it had two costs: it was proportional to chain depth, up to four
//!    dependent loads through prototype objects that are usually cold; and it
//!    was a LOOP, so the hit could only ever live behind a call. An emitted
//!    read site cannot branch on a variable number of compares.
//! 2. The receiver's `(class_id, ShapeId)` pair — ONE aligned 8-byte load at
//!    offset 0 — equals what was recorded. This is what makes a shadowing own
//!    key safe: adding `o.a` to the receiver is a key-add transition, which
//!    mints a different ShapeId, so the entry simply stops matching. Priming
//!    requires the key to be absent from the receiver's key list ENTIRELY (not
//!    present as a `TAG_HOLE` tombstone), so no stable-tombstone re-add can
//!    reinstate an own key under an unchanged ShapeId.
//! 3. The receiver's recorded prototype bits (`ObjectMeta.prototype`, 0 when
//!    there is no meta record) are unchanged. This is NOT redundant with the
//!    validity word: `object_link_class_default_prototype` links a FRESH
//!    instance to its class's prototype object without bumping any epoch and
//!    without transitioning a shape (by design — the loud variant flushed the
//!    plan cache on every construction). A later `C.prototype = other`
//!    followed by `new C()` therefore produces a receiver with the SAME class
//!    id and the SAME ShapeId as the cached one and a different chain, and
//!    this compare is what refuses it.
//! 4. The key pointer is identical. Keys are interned, so pointer identity is
//!    key identity — see the GC contract below for why the pointer cannot be
//!    reused by a different string while an entry names it.
//!
//! Conditions that are proved ONCE, at prime time, and held afterwards by the
//! validity word rather than re-checked: object kind is `Ordinary`; no
//! accessor and no customized descriptor for this key anywhere on the chain
//! (both transition the shape of the object they are installed on, and every
//! hop is marked, so either would have bumped the counter); the slot is inline
//! rather than spilled.
//!
//! Conditions re-checked on every hit because they are properties of the
//! ADDRESS rather than of the shape, and all three now live in ONE word this
//! path already loads (`ObjectMeta::flags`, plus `elements` beside it): the
//! receiver is not `process.env`, not an `arguments` object, and carries no
//! `elements` store. The first two were two address-keyed registry probes
//! costing 14.0 and 5.0 instructions on every cached read — and, decisively
//! for the emitted sequence, a compiled read site could not have called
//! either one.
//!
//! # GC contract
//!
//! The collector moves objects, so a recorded holder address is a liability.
//! Three things together make it safe, and each is necessary:
//!
//! * **`scan_inherited_read_cache_roots_mut` MARKS every key, hop and the
//!   holder**, so the
//!   collector keeps them alive and rewrites this table's copy of their
//!   addresses. A hit LOADS `holder + slot`, which is what separates this
//!   cache from the transition cache #6759 phase 3 made weak: that one only
//!   ever COMPARES addresses, so a dangling slot costs it a miss, while here
//!   it would be a read of recycled memory returning a wrong value. The
//!   retention is bounded by the table (512 keys, 512 x 4 prototypes).
//! * **`prune_dead_inherited_cache_entries` drops entries whose key or any hop
//!   the collector reports dead.** Marking above means it should never have
//!   one to drop; it is registered in `DEAD_KEY_PRUNES` anyway because that
//!   registry is the runtime's checked list of tables re-keyed by a visitor
//!   (`gc::dead_owner`'s #8174 note), and it is the only thing standing
//!   between a recycled address and a false hit should a collection flavour
//!   ever sweep without running the scanner. `young_prune: None`, so the full
//!   512-entry walk runs on every flavour including minors - cheap at this
//!   size.
//! * **Priming does NOT refuse a nursery hop.** It did, and that made the
//!   cache useless for the programs that need it most: a read-only loop
//!   allocates nothing, nothing is ever promoted, and every prototype stays in
//!   the nursery for the life of the process. Measured cost of that refusal:
//!   +264 instructions per inherited read, for a chain walk performed and then
//!   discarded.
//!
//! # Refusals are recorded too
//!
//! Most reads that reach this cache are ones it cannot serve: an accessor on
//! the prototype, a key that is on no prototype at all, a receiver whose kind
//! it refuses. If a refusal is not recorded, each of those pays for a full
//! chain walk on EVERY read and the cache is a net loss — measured at +424
//! instructions per read for an accessor on the prototype, against a build
//! with no cache at all.
//!
//! So a declining walk writes a NEGATIVE entry (`slot == NEGATIVE_SLOT`) and
//! [`inherited_read_cache_lookup`] answers `Declined`, which tells
//! `get_field_ic_miss_impl` not to walk. A negative entry can never return a
//! wrong value — the worst it can do is keep a read on the path it is already
//! on — so its invalidation may be weaker than a hit's. It reuses the hit's
//! identity, epoch and per-hop stamp compares unchanged, which is what lets
//! `proto.a = 1` after a failed lookup re-open the pair.
//!
//! One class of refusal is NOT recorded: one caused by a VALUE — an
//! `undefined`, `null` or hole in the holder's slot. A plain store can replace
//! such a value with a real one while transitioning no shape and bumping no
//! epoch, so a negative entry for it would stand for the life of the process.
//! Every other refusal is a function of a shape or a descriptor.
//!
//! # Why every hop is still recorded when only the holder is read
//!
//! The hit loads `holder + slot` and never touches an interior hop, so the
//! `hops` array exists for the collector, not for the read. Dropping the
//! interior hops would make this entry able to hit for a receiver whose
//! recorded prototype bits name an address the collector recycled: the
//! intermediate prototype is kept alive by the receiver in every real
//! program, but this table does not root receivers, so nothing else is
//! keeping it from being freed and its address reused. Rooting the whole
//! chain costs GC time and nothing at read time.
//!
//! # Hook points for lane 4
//!
//! Two, both one call wide:
//!   * [`inherited_read_cache_hit`] — the guard-and-load. Called at the top of
//!     `js_object_get_field_by_name` and of `get_field_ic_miss_impl`.
//!   * [`inherited_read_cache_prime`] — the chain walk. Called from
//!     `get_field_ic_miss_impl` only, at the point where the own-key search has
//!     already failed, so it never duplicates work on an own read.
//!
//! An emitted-code hit would call `js_inherited_read_cache_hit_f64`, the
//! `extern "C"` wrapper at the bottom of this file, with the receiver's masked
//! pointer and the interned key.
