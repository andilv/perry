/// Static "null object" used as a safe return value when the depth guard triggers.
/// Instead of returning undefined (which callers may dereference as a null pointer),
/// we return a pointer to this valid-but-empty object so downstream code doesn't crash.
///
/// Uses a raw byte array with matching layout to avoid Sync issues with raw pointers.
///
/// #8047: mirrors the 16-byte header on both LP64 and ILP32. The trailing zero
/// word is `meta` on LP64 and `{alignment padding, meta}` on ILP32.
