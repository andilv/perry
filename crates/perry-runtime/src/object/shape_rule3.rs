//! Rule 3 of the single-path object model: **no pointer-tagged non-object
//! cell may hold a value in the ShapeId range at payload offset `+4`.**
//!
//! The emitted read path derives its shape token from a raw 32-bit load at
//! `receiver + 4` and compares it against the site's cached ShapeId
//! (`perry-codegen/src/expr/property_get/generic_dispatch.rs`). Today that
//! compare is fenced by a GC-header load proving `obj_type == GC_TYPE_OBJECT`.
//! The point of the rule is to make that fence removable: if no other cell
//! kind can produce a `+4` word inside `[SHAPE_ID_BASE, SHAPE_ID_END)`, a
//! shape compare that succeeds has already proved the receiver is a shaped
//! ordinary object.
//!
//! Every kind's `+4` word, and why it is safe, is enumerated by
//! [`RULE3_KINDS`] below — a table the tests walk, so a new `GC_TYPE_*`
//! cannot be added without classifying it.
//!
//! Two mechanisms close the rule, and which one a kind uses is a property of
//! what the word *is*:
//!
//! * A **count** (array/map/set/buffer/typed-array/native-view capacity) is
//!   bounded in RELEASE at its allocation and growth funnels by
//!   [`checked_plus_four_word`] / `array_capacity_or_throw`, which reject a
//!   request at or above [`MAX_PLUS_FOUR_WORD`] with the kind's own
//!   `RangeError` *before* any memory is reserved. A debug assertion beside
//!   each `+4` store is the backstop for a funnel someone adds later.
//! * A word that is **arbitrary data** is moved. `DateCell` held an `f64`
//!   time value at `+0`, and `new Date(-1)` puts `0xBFF0_0000` at `+4` —
//!   inside the ShapeId range with no bound to appeal to. The cell is
//!   relaid out so `+0..8` is its `ObjectMeta` edge and the timestamp starts
//!   at `+8`; a heap pointer's high half is bounded by the collector's own
//!   address ceiling ([`MAX_HEAP_ADDR_EXCLUSIVE`]), which is the argument
//!   eight other kinds in the table already rest on.
