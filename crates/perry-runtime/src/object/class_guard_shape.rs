//! The per-class guard expectation: the poisonable carrier that replaced the
//! `@PERRY_CLASS_FIELD_INLINE_GUARD_DISABLED` latch on the per-access
//! class-field guard.
//!
//! # Why a second global, beside the ShapeId
//!
//! The obvious move is to poison `@perry_class_shape_id_*` itself — the guard
//! already loads it, so disabling the fast path would cost nothing. That is
//! UNSOUND: `js_object_alloc_class_inline_keys_stamped` stamps every newly
//! allocated instance with the value read out of that global
//! (`perry-codegen/src/lower_call/new_alloc.rs`), so poisoning it would brand
//! live objects with a bogus ShapeId rather than close a fast path.
//!
//! `@perry_class_guard_shape_*` is seeded with the same ShapeId at module init
//! and is only ever COMPARED against, never stamped — so it is safe to poison,
//! and the guard gets the latch's authority out of a load it was making
//! anyway. Net on the emitted fast path of a static-key read: 28 -> 23 ARM64
//! instructions, and one fewer dependent load (the latch was an `external
//! global`, so reading it cost a GOT load plus an `ldrb` through it).
