//! Split out of `object/mod.rs` for the 2,000-line gate, which the record's
//! sixteenth word (#10868 step 2.5 stage 1's `dictionary_keys`) took past the
//! cap. The struct and its `offset_of!` pins are one unit — the pins exist
//! precisely because `perry-codegen` reaches words 4, 6, 7 and 12 by index —
//! so they move together or the contract is split from the thing it
//! constrains.

//! Moving it also makes `object/mod.rs` a file one lane at a time no longer
//! has to share: the record and the transition cache were the two regions in
//! it owned by different lanes of the One Path campaign.

/// #6759 Phase B: per-object metadata record, reached from
/// [`ObjectHeader::meta`] in two dependent loads (no side-table probe).
///
/// GC-arena allocated (`GC_TYPE_OBJECT_META`). Its header slot is a traced +
/// rewritten child edge (the record is reachable ONLY through its owner),
/// so liveness, evacuation, and death all ride the ordinary GC — no manual
/// free paths, no owner registry, and no stale-address hazard: the record
/// dies with (and only with) its owner.
///
/// Only the authoritative `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` kind has this layout. RegExp uses
/// its own GC kind and slot descriptor, so no ObjectHeader consumer needs to
/// inspect its native payload to disambiguate the two.
///
/// The shipped Phase B record holds the custom `[[Prototype]]`, the Phase C2
/// per-key descriptor summaries, object flags, and owned spill storage. The
/// RFC also sketched an exotic-kind tag here, but Date/RegExp/Error/Promise/
/// Map/Set/Temporal have distinct cell layouts rather than an `ObjectHeader`;
/// representing their kind here first requires header unification. Their
/// expando payloads therefore remain in the per-thread `RuntimeState` with GC
/// rekey/prune defenses instead of being described as the next incremental
