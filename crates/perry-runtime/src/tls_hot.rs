//! One thread-local resolution for the whole allocation hot path (#7469).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! On Darwin every `thread_local!` access is an out-of-line call to
//! `_tlv_get_addr` in `libdyld`. Unlike ELF's `local-exec` / `initial-exec`
//! models it is a real call — not inlined, not cached across accesses, and it
//! clobbers caller-saved registers at the site. LLVM *can* CSE repeated
//! accesses to the **same** thread-local within a function, but two different
//! thread-locals are two different descriptors, so N distinct thread-locals on
//! one code path cost N calls no matter how well the path inlines.
//!
//! The runtime declares 237 `thread_local!` blocks, and a single
//! `{v, w}` object literal touches roughly a dozen of them: the arena and its
//! inline bump state, the free-list flag, the birth-flag cell, the layout side
//! tables, the page-generation cache the write barrier classifies against, and
//! the temp-root stack. Measured on `gc-handoff/bench/churn.ts` at
//! `351742d30`, `_tlv_get_addr` was **34.2% of all self time** — more than the
//! allocation work it was gating, and invisible to `PERRY_GC_TRACE` because it
//! is mutator time, not pause time.
//!
//! # What this does
//!
//! [`HotTls`] caches the **addresses** of those thread-locals in one
//! `const`-initialised thread-local. The storage does not move: every field is
//! the address of the existing `thread_local!` in its owning module, so
//! initialisation order, lazy init, and destructor registration are all
//! unchanged. A hot path that used to pay N `_tlv_get_addr` calls now pays one
//! (for `HOT` itself, which LLVM then CSEs across the whole inlined region)
//! plus N loads from one cache line.
//!
//! # Contract for adding a field
//!
//! 1. Add the `*mut u8` slot below.
//! 2. Add a `pub(crate) fn …_hot_addr() -> *mut u8` next to the `thread_local!`
//!    that owns the storage, returning `KEY.with(|k| k as *const _ as *mut u8)`.
//! 3. Wire it in [`fill`].
//! 4. Add the pair to `tls_hot::tests::cached_addresses_match_thread_locals`.
//!
//! Step 4 is the load-bearing one: the slots are untyped (`*mut u8`) so the
//! owning module can keep its storage type private, which means a mis-wired
//! `fill` would hand out a correctly-typed reference to the *wrong* object.
//! The test compares each cached address against the `.with()` address it is
//! supposed to mirror, so a mis-wire is a red build rather than a silent
//! cross-cast.
//!
//! # Lifetime
//!
//! The accessors hand out `&'static` references. That is sound for the *cache*
//! (const-init, no `Drop`, so it is never destroyed) and carries exactly the
//! same thread-teardown exposure the runtime already has for `ARENA` and
//! `INLINE_STATE`, whose raw pointers are handed to generated code by
//! `js_inline_arena_state`. It is not an invitation to send one across
//! threads, and the pointee types (`Cell`, `RefCell`, `UnsafeCell`) are all
//! `!Sync`, so the compiler refuses that on its own.
//!
//! # Reaching the cache without a TLS resolution (#7469 structural half)
//!
//! Caching the addresses removed the *per-field* resolutions but left one:
//! `HOT` is itself a `thread_local!`, so every runtime function that reads any
//! hot field still paid one `_tlv_get_addr` call. Symbolicated on the pinned
//! quiet host at `9938cbc1a`, that residue was **27.0% of `churn_alloc`**, and
//! its call-graph attribution was not diffuse: **seven functions carried 98%
//! of it, and every one of the seven resolves `HOT`** —
//! `write_barrier_decoded_parent` (19.3%), `layout_forget_object` (18.9%),
//! `js_object_alloc_class_inline_keys` (18.5%), `arena_alloc` (14.9%),
//! `js_write_barrier_slot` (9.2%), `barrier_child_prologue` (8.8%) and
//! `typed_shape_layout_entry` (8.4%). Two of them resolve *nothing else*.
//!
//! So the structural fix is to make reaching `HOT` free rather than to thread a
//! context pointer through 2994 `.with()` sites. On Apple aarch64 the pthread
//! thread-specific-data array is directly addressable from `TPIDRRO_EL0` —
//! that is how `pthread_getspecific` itself is implemented, and what mimalloc
//! (already linked into this runtime) does on this platform. Publishing the
//! cache's address into one `pthread_key_create` slot turns the resolution
//! from an out-of-line call that clobbers caller-saved registers into `mrs` +
//! two loads that LLVM can CSE across a whole function.
//!
//! [`darwin_tsd`] carries the self-check that makes this safe to ship: the
//! publishing thread reads the slot back through the direct path and compares
//! it against what `pthread_setspecific` was handed. A mismatch — the shape a
//! future OS change would take — disables the direct path process-wide and
//! every thread falls back to `_tlv_get_addr`, permanently and silently
//! correctly. It cannot degrade into reading a wrong address.
