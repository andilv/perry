/// reaches; #7469 already measured 16 ways as an 8.6 % regression for 1.5 %

/// with one bounds compare and one load. The same bounds check rejects the
/// ~8,000 candidate addresses per turn that are in no registered block — the
/// other 22 % of misses — without a separate filter.
///
/// # What it is not
/// A cache, not the truth. `PageGenerationMap` stays authoritative: every miss
/// falls through to it exactly as before, and every registration, unregistration
/// and retag invalidates the whole table by bumping `epoch` (O(1), and the same
/// "clear everything" contract the 4-way set had, for the same reason: a stale
/// entry is exactly what this guards against). A hit still requires
/// `range.contains(addr)` — a key match at a range boundary is not an address
/// match.
///
/// # The one place the table is WEAKER than the set it replaces
/// A class can hold more than one range (`PageGenerationSlot::Multiple`). The
/// 4-way set could hold two of them at once, in two ways under the same key,
/// and hit on both; the table has one slot per class, so ranges sharing a
/// class evict each other and alternate accesses miss. This is a real
/// regression in kind, bounded by how many classes are `Multiple` — and it is
/// what the `[gc-page-class]` miss rate would show if the collapse predicted
/// below fails to appear. Registered blocks are `BLOCK_SIZE`-sized and
/// `BLOCK_SIZE == 1 << GENERATION_CLASS_SHIFT`, so one block is exactly one
/// class and the multi-range case is the sub-block registration, not the norm.
///
/// # The two things measurement did not settle, handled explicitly
/// * **The base moves per process** (observed: `0x43daa2` vs `0x57e3c2` on two
///   runs). It is taken from the first insert, minus slack — never compiled in.
/// * **The span can grow** (observed: 1,018 vs 1,021 on two runs of one
///   binary). An insert outside `[base, base + len)` rebases the table to cover
///   it, up to `PAGE_CLASS_TABLE_MAX_SPAN`; past the cap the key is left
///   uncached and falls through. Both paths are pinned by tests that fail when
///   the fallback is removed, because a wrong answer here is a misclassified
///   pointer — a collector that moves the wrong thing.
///
/// Stored behind an `UnsafeCell`, not a `Cell`, for the reason recorded on the
/// 4-way set when it was switched: `Cell::get` returns a **copy**, and copying
/// the set on every classification cost more than the map lookup the cache
/// exists to avoid (a ~2 % regression on `retain.ts`). That argument is
/// stronger here, not weaker — the table is far larger than the set was.
/// Access is single-threaded by construction: the cell is thread-local and no
