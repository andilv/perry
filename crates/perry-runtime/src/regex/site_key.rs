//! Literal-site keyed construction cache for `RegExp` — O(1), no hashing, no
//! byte compare.
//!
//! # Why this exists next to `site_cache`
//!
//! [`super::site_cache`] answers "have I seen this pattern TEXT before?" and
//! is what a dynamic `new RegExp(s)` needs. It is keyed by a content
//! fingerprint and, because a fingerprint can collide, every hit is verified
//! by a **full byte compare of the pattern**. That verify is linear in the
//! pattern, and a regex literal evaluates to a fresh object every time it is
//! reached: on claude-code the segment loop constructs `string-width`'s
//! ~12,807-character `/…/g` once per grapheme, so the verify alone is ~2.0 GB
//! of `memcmp` per 400-character reply and 39.6 % of `js_regexp_new`'s own
//! profile subtree.
//!
//! A literal does not need to be identified by its text. It is one source
//! site, and its pattern and flags are fixed at compile time. The compiler now
//! says so: `Expr::RegExp` emits an 8-byte private global per literal site and
//! passes its ADDRESS as `site_key` (`expr/logical_collections.rs`), and
//! [`js_regexp_new_site`](super::js_regexp_new_site) probes this table with
//! it.
//!
//! # Why the key is sound, and why the string handles are not
//!
//! Identity by address is only sound while the address cannot be reused for
//! something else. A `StringHeader` address fails that twice over — headers
//! are GC-managed, so an address is freed and reused, and a moving collector
//! relocates them — which is why the earlier analysis of this problem
//! concluded no sound string identity was available and left the content
//! compare in place.
//!
//! A per-site global has neither problem: it is emitted by the compiler into
//! the image, never freed, never moved, and distinct sites are distinct
//! globals and therefore distinct addresses. So an entry is verified by
//! comparing ONE WORD, and the pattern is never read at all — not hashed, not
//! fingerprinted, not compared.
//!
//! What that leaves per construction on a hit: two `Arc` refcount bumps for
//! the shared `(pattern, flags)` text, the program handles if the site has
//! been executed once, and the header allocation itself. No validation (the
//! first construction at this site did it, and validity is a pure function of
//! the pair), no flag canonicalization, no fingerprint, no `memcmp`.
//!
//! Kill switch: `PERRY_REGEX_SITE_KEY=0` (every probe misses and nothing is
//! recorded, so the construction falls through to the content-keyed path
//! exactly as before this existed).
