/// #7187 Phase A — is the remembered-set half of the write barrier armed?
///
/// The remembered set has exactly one consumer: a collection, and every
/// collector reaches it through [`remembered_dirty_snapshot`] (see that
/// function for why that is the *sole* read path). Until the first such read,
/// maintaining the log buys nothing — and on `batch.ts` it is the program's
/// single largest cost: #7170 measured `classify_heap_generation` at 19.03%
/// (657M instructions) with **zero collections running**, reached from this
/// barrier on the sort's own element stores.
///
/// So the log starts unarmed and records nothing. The exchange, and the whole
/// soundness argument, lives on the *reading* side: the first snapshot on a
/// thread does not trust the log at all — it reconstructs the complete
/// old→young edge set from the heap
/// ([`arm_and_reconstruct_remembered_set_if_unarmed`]) and arms the barrier on
/// the way past. From then on the barrier maintains it incrementally exactly
/// as before.
///
/// **The naive premise "nothing has collected, so there is no old generation"
/// is false and is deliberately not used here.** `arena_alloc_gc` routes any
/// allocation over `LARGE_OBJECT_THRESHOLD_BYTES` straight to
/// `arena_alloc_gc_old`, so old-gen exists from the first large allocation —
/// `batch.ts`'s own 40 000-element arrays are born old while every record they
/// hold is nursery. `note_array_slot_layout_only`'s comment in
/// `array/header.rs` is the postmortem of the last time that was got wrong
/// ("155 edges, all born-old array→young object"). The reconstruct, not the
/// flag, is what makes this sound.
///
/// A process-global `AtomicBool` rather than a thread-local: arming is
/// monotone and one-way, and conservative in the early direction (a thread
/// that arms early merely stops being free), while a `thread_local!` costs a
/// `_tlv_get_addr` *call* on macOS on a path that runs on every heap store.
/// Per-thread state — "has *this* thread reconstructed yet" — stays in
/// [`REMEMBERED_SET_RECONSTRUCTED`], where a wrong answer would matter.
///
/// **In `cfg(test)` builds this starts ARMED**, and so does
/// [`REMEMBERED_SET_RECONSTRUCTED`]. The runtime's existing barrier unit tests
/// assert the armed steady state — they hand-build an old parent and a young
/// child and expect the store to be logged — and they are right to: that is
/// the state every program is in after its first collection. Letting them
/// observe the unarmed window instead would have deleted their subject
/// wholesale, and made the suite order-dependent besides (the first test that
/// collects arms the process for every later test). The unarmed window gets
/// dedicated tests that opt back out via [`reset_barrier_arming_for_tests`],
/// plus end-to-end coverage from every compiled binary the parity/gap suites
/// run — those start unarmed for real.
