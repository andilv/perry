//! Research precise-root backend for LLVM stack maps.
//!
//! The plain-map prototype places `llvm.experimental.stackmap` immediately
//! before mapped calls and records the address of each native root alloca.
//! The statepoint prototype instead records LLVM-owned spill slots for
//! `gc.relocate` values. Both are writable frame-register-relative locations
//! in the emitted stack-map section.
//!
//! This first implementation deliberately targets macOS, where the experiment
//! is being measured. It discovers the concatenated `__PERRY_GCMAP` section
//! in the main Mach-O image and uses the platform unwinder to recover the
//! frame-register value for each active generated frame. Unsupported targets
//! return no roots; neither native-stack experiment may be used for correctness
//! there.
