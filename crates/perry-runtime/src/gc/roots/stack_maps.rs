//! Precise GC roots read from native frames, via LLVM statepoints.
//!
//! Under `PERRY_RS4GC=1` the compiler runs `RewriteStatepointsForGC`, which
//! records each live root as an LLVM-owned spill slot for a `gc.relocate`
//! value: a writable, frame-register-relative location in the emitted
//! stack-map section. This module finds that section in the running image,
//! walks the native frames, and hands each live slot to the collector as a
//! `MutableRootSlot` — mutable because evacuation rewrites through it.
//!
//! A second lowering used to exist, placing `llvm.experimental.stackmap`
//! before mapped calls and recording alloca addresses directly. It was
//! unsound and is deleted; only the statepoint path remains, so there is no
//! backend selection here and no fallback between them.
//!
//! Platform support is per-shape, not one target: Apple (macOS/iOS/iPadOS/
//! tvOS/watchOS) reads a concatenated `__PERRY_GCMAP` Mach-O section, Linux
//! reads `.perry_gcmap` from ELF, and Windows reads `.pgcmap` from the PE
//! image. Frame walking is per-platform too — an x29 chain walk where the
//! map proves every frame is chain-walkable, the Itanium unwinder elsewhere
//! on Unix, and `RtlVirtualUnwind` on Windows. Targets outside that set
//! return no roots, and the compiler refuses to emit a map for them rather
//! than producing a binary whose collector would silently free live objects.
