//! The two aarch64 walkers, run against one frame whose layout we chose.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Before this file, **nothing `cargo test` runs ever called `fp_chain::visit`
//! or `unwind::visit`.** Their only coverage was `PERRY_STACKMAP_WALKER=verify`
//! inside one arm of `gc-native-roots.yml` — a workflow that had never had a
//! successful run on any branch (#7970), and whose aarch64-ELF arm is red on
//! #7984 precisely because the two walkers resolve one root 96 bytes apart.
//! Every unit test around them tested the *decoder* and the *matcher*; the part
//! that turns a `(register, offset)` pair into a stack address had none.
//!
//! # What it asserts, and why set equality is not enough
//!
//! `verify` compares the two walkers' slot sets. Two empty sets are equal, and
//! so are two identically-wrong sets — that is a presence check, not a proof.
//! The discriminating quantity here is the **contents** of the resolved slot:
//! the probe frame writes a sentinel into the exact word its synthetic
//! stack-map record names, and each walker must independently land on a word
//! holding that sentinel. A walker that visits nothing fails; a walker that
//! visits the wrong word fails even if the other walker agrees with it.
//!
//! `a_wrong_frame_offset_is_caught` is the sabotage arm: it feeds a record
//! whose offset is deliberately 8 bytes off and requires the sentinel check to
//! reject it. Without that, a green run here would only mean the assertions
//! never ran.
//!
//! # The frame layouts
//!
//! Both are copied from real generated code for the same TypeScript function,
//! because they differ per object format and the difference is load-bearing:
//! LLVM's AArch64 **ELF** frame lowering puts the `x29,x30` pair *below* the
//! other callee-saved registers, so the frame record sits in the MIDDLE of the
//! frame and `x29 - body_sp` is small; Mach-O puts it at the TOP. Measured on
//! `benchmarks/gc_ratchet/probes/01_nursery_churn.ts`, the anon-shape
//! constructor: ELF `sub sp,sp,#96 / stp x29,x30,[sp,#40] / add x29,sp,#40`,
//! Mach-O `sub sp,sp,#112 / stp x29,x30,[sp,#96] / add x29,sp,#96`. Both are
//! exercised here on whichever host runs the suite, since the walkers care
//! about the layout and not about the object format that motivated it.
