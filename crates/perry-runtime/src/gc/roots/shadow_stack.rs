//! Precise shadow-stack roots.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! One thread-local `Vec<ShadowEntry>` holds every frame back-to-back. A frame
//! is `SHADOW_STACK_HEADER_SLOTS` header entries followed by its slots:
//!
//! ```text
//!   [ header: value = caller frame_top, meta = slot_count ][ slot 0 ][ slot 1 ] ...
//!   ^ frame_handle (base)                                  ^ frame_top
//! ```
//!
//! Before this rewrite the three per-slot words lived in three parallel `Vec`s
//! (`stack: Vec<u64>`, `slot_ptrs: Vec<usize>`, `active: Vec<bool>`) and the
//! header took two `u64` words. That cost every frame push five separate
//! capacity checks and three `resize` calls — two of which lowered to a
//! `memset` **call** for the 2–4-slot frames codegen actually emits — and cost
//! every slot store three independent bounds checks against three `Vec`
//! headers. Interleaving the three words into one 16-byte entry makes a push
//! one capacity check plus a handful of `stp`s, and a slot store one bounds
//! check against one length.

/// `setjmp` site WITHOUT running the epilogues of the functions being
/// unwound past. Those functions emitted `js_shadow_frame_pop` before
/// their `ret`, so on a normal return the shadow stack stays balanced —
/// but a `longjmp` jumps straight over every skipped pop. The shadow
/// stack's `frame_top` is then left pointing at the deepest (now-dead)
/// callee frame. Until the unwinding function eventually returns, any GC
/// that scans roots (`visit_shadow_stack_root_slots`) would walk those
/// orphaned frames, reading — and, on the copying/evacuating path,
/// *writing back into* — bound slot pointers that point into stack memory
/// that has already been unwound and is being reused by the catch body.
