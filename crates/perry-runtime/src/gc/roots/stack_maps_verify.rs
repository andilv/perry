//! `PERRY_STACKMAP_WALKER=verify`: run both walkers and require them to agree.
//!
//! This is the only check that can catch a fast walk that silently skips
//! frames or resolves a root against the wrong frame base. Forced-evacuation
//! verification cannot: it enumerates roots through the same walker, so it
//! never sees a slot the walker never reached, and it has no idea what a root
//! slot is *supposed* to contain — a wrong stack word looks exactly like a
//! right one.
//!
//! # Why the report is this detailed
//!
//! The first end-to-end `verify` run on aarch64 ELF caught the fp-chain walker
//! and the unwinder resolving one root 96 bytes apart (#7984). All the panic
//! could say was
//!
//! ```text
//! fast walk visited 1 unique slots, unwinder visited 1
//!   left:  [281474742909688]
//!   right: [281474742909592]
//! ```
//!
//! — two integers, from which the frame, the base register, the function whose
//! prologue was decoded, and therefore *which walker was wrong* are all
//! unrecoverable. Every candidate explanation (a missed trailing `sub sp`, a
//! frame the chain skipped, a CFA that is one frame out) predicts exactly that
//! output, so the gate could prove a bug existed and nothing about its shape.
//!
//! A gate that cannot name what it found sends whoever picks it up back to
//! square one, so this one prints the provenance of every root both walkers
//! resolved: the frame return address it was matched on, the function the
//! record belongs to, the base register and frame offset from the map, the
//! base each walker resolved that register to, and — on aarch64 — the
//! prologue words `fp_to_sp_offset` decoded to derive an SP base. That is
//! enough to say which walker is wrong without a second run.
