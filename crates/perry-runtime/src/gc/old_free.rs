//! Old-generation hole free list (#7437).
//!
//! Old-gen allocation was pure bump: a swept dead old object stayed dead
//! capacity until its *entire block* died, and a block with even one live
//! object never resets. A workload that promotes a large cohort and keeps
//! a scattered subset (every-64th node in the `12_large_live_set` ratchet
//! probe) therefore retained 105 MB of blocks for a ~1 MB live set — the
//! final full collection freed 87 MB of objects and reclaimed nothing,
//! because 49 of 50 blocks still held at least one live object. The same
//! mechanism is a large slice of tree.ts's old-gen churn high-water
//! (#7438): every dropped tree leaves holes in blocks pinned live by the
//! next tree's nodes.
//!
//! This module gives the old generation what the general arena has had
//! all along (`ARENA_FREE_LIST`): swept holes become reusable. Shape
//! differences are deliberate:
//!
//! - **Exact fit only, keyed by total (header-inclusive, padded) size.**
//!   The general list best-fits into larger slots and keeps the slot's
//!   original `GcHeader::size`, which is fine there because nothing else
//!   accounts those bytes. Old-gen promotion *does* account per-object
//!   sizes (`old_page_account_promoted_object`), so a reused slot must
//!   have exactly the size the caller asked for or the page live-byte
//!   accounting diverges from the header. Promoted cohorts are dominated
//!   by uniform class-instance sizes, so exact fit hits where the
//!   pathology lives.
//! - **One chain per size, not one scanned list.** The pathological case
//!   has hundreds of thousands of holes; a per-allocation linear scan would
//!   put an O(holes) tax on every promotion. A take pops its size's head.
//! - **Intrusive, no per-hole side storage (#11505).** The list is threaded
//!   through the holes themselves: a listed hole's first payload word (the
//!   word right after its invalidated header) holds the user pointer of the
//!   next listed hole of the same size, `0` ending the chain. The only state
//!   outside the heap is one head per size class — a direct-indexed array for
//!   the small sizes promoted cohorts are made of, and a size -> head map for
//!   the rest, holding one entry per distinct size rather than one per hole.
//!   The earlier shape kept a `Vec` of hole addresses per size: every swept
//!   hole cost a push (plus that vector's growth reallocations), and every
//!   rebuild freed the vectors and grew them again.
//!
//!   The header stays exactly as `invalidate_dead_old_arena_header` left it
//!   (`obj_type == 0`, `size` intact), so everything that classifies a
//!   header sees the same dead hole it always did: the walkable-gated
//!   walkers skip `obj_type == 0` without reading the payload, the raw-header
//!   walker the rebuild uses reads headers only, address lookups reject
//!   `obj_type == 0`, and nothing traces a dead object's payload. Only the
//!   first payload word changes. A hole too small to carry the link (`size <
//!   OLD_FREE_MIN_HOLE`) is simply not listed.
//!
//! `OLD_ARENA_FREE_BYTES` tracks the total. It is deliberately NOT
//! subtracted from `OLD_GEN_IN_USE_BYTES` — that cache is defined (and
//! debug-asserted) as the sum of old block offsets, which hole reuse does
//! not change. Consumers that want old-generation pressure subtract
//! [`old_free_bytes`]. The live-allocation census used by
//! `process.memoryUsage().heapUsed` and major pacing excludes these holes at
//! collection time and observes later reuse through the decrease in this
//! counter; before this, dead-but-reusable bytes counted as pressure, so
//! reclaim kept re-firing full collections that could not lower the number it
//! was watching.
//!
//! Entries are only pushed for dead objects in blocks that still hold a
//! live object (fully-dead blocks go through block reclaim, which is
//! strictly better). A pushed entry's block can still die on a LATER
//! cycle, so every old-block reset/dealloc site must unlink the holes in
//! the range it is about to recycle ([`old_free_filter_range`]) BEFORE the
//! bytes are reused or released — the chain runs through those bytes, so a
//! hole left listed in a recycled block corrupts every chain it is on, not
//! just its own entry. Unlinking walks every chain, and a walk now chases
//! links through the heap instead of scanning a dense vector, so the rebuild
//! also records on each old block whether it listed a hole there
//! (`ArenaBlock::old_free_holes`); the reset sites filter only a block whose
//! bit is set, and every other dead block costs nothing.
