//! The **per-object** halves of the GC slot-layout metadata, and the emptiness
//! flag that keeps them off the hot path (#7510).
//!
//! Two address-keyed thread-locals live here:
//!
//! - [`LAYOUT_SLOT_MASKS`] — which slots of an object hold pointers.
//! - [`TYPED_LAYOUTS`] — the object's canonical `TypedLayoutDescriptor`.
//!
//! Both predate #6893, which moved the *common* case — an object whose live
//! layout still matches its shape — into the shape-keyed `SHAPE_LAYOUTS` map
//! in [`super::layout`]. What is left in these two maps is the residue:
//! objects that **diverged** from their shape, objects with no `keys_array`,
//! and ambiguous shapes. On a monomorphic workload that residue is empty for
//! the entire run.
//!
//! Empty is not the same as free, though. Every allocation
//! (`layout_init_pointer_free`), every typed-shape install, every object death
//! (`layout_clear_for_ptr`) and every relocation (`layout_transfer`) probed
//! both maps to clear whatever a previous tenant of a recycled address might
//! have left. Two `RefCell` round-trips plus two hashes, per object, to remove
//! nothing: `layout_forget_object` was 14.5% of self time on the
//! object-construction profile in #7510, nearly twice the allocator it was
//! bookkeeping for.
//!
//! [`PER_OBJECT_LAYOUTS_NONEMPTY`] answers "is there anything in either map at
//! all" in a single load, and every mutating path in this module maintains it.
//! Callers outside get the guarded accessors, not the maps.
//!
//! Split out of `layout.rs` to stay under the repo's 2000-line-per-file cap
//! (`scripts/check_file_size.sh`).
