//! The **per-object** halves of the GC slot-layout metadata, and the emptiness
//! flag that keeps them off the hot path (#7510).
//!
//! Two address-keyed thread-locals live here:
//!
//! - [`LAYOUT_SLOT_MASKS`] — which slots of an object hold pointers.
//! - [`TYPED_LAYOUTS`] — the object's canonical `TypedLayoutDescriptor`.
//!
//! Both predate #6893, which moved the *common* case — an object whose live
//! layout still matches its shape — into the shape-keyed `SHAPE_LAYOUTS` map
//! in [`super::layout`]. What is left in these two maps is the residue:
//! objects that **diverged** from their shape, objects with no `keys_array`,
//! and ambiguous shapes. On a monomorphic workload that residue is empty for
//! the entire run.
//!
//! Empty is not the same as free, though. Every allocation
//! (`layout_init_pointer_free`), every typed-shape install, every object death
//! (`layout_clear_for_ptr`) and every relocation (`layout_transfer`) probed
//! both maps to clear whatever a previous tenant of a recycled address might
//! have left. Two `RefCell` round-trips plus two hashes, per object, to remove
//! nothing: `layout_forget_object` was 14.5% of self time on the
//! object-construction profile in #7510, nearly twice the allocator it was
//! bookkeeping for.
//!
//! [`PER_OBJECT_LAYOUTS_NONEMPTY`] answers "is there anything in either map at
//! all" in a single load, and every mutating path in this module maintains it.
//! Callers outside get the guarded accessors, not the maps.
//!
//! Split out of `layout.rs` to stay under the repo's 2000-line-per-file cap
//! (`scripts/check_file_size.sh`).

/// A minor's two deadness predicates both require the owner to be in the
/// nursery: `owner_is_dead_copied_minor_from_space` demands eden or the active
/// survivor half, and `PostTraceProbe::owner_is_dead` on a minor demands an
/// in-arena, untenured `HeapGeneration::Nursery` address. So the only keys a
/// minor can remove are the ones [`layout_key_may_be_nursery`] admits — which
/// is a strict SUPERSET of both (it also admits an unclassifiable address, and
/// classifies from the same page map). Every writer notes such a key before
/// the entry becomes findable, and every walk re-logs a survivor that is still
/// young, so the log names every candidate and the walk loses nothing.
///
/// That predicate is the whole difference between this conversion and the
/// scanner conversions of #9754: a scanner keeps `addr_is_minor_relevant`,
/// which admits `Longlived` **by design** (a longlived object can point at a
/// young one), whereas a prune asks who DIED and therefore excludes
/// `Longlived` and `Old` both.
///
/// A logged key that is in neither map is stale (moved away, removed) and
/// drops; a present key whose owner is dead is removed from both maps; a live
/// key is re-logged iff its owner is still young, so a promoted owner leaves
/// the log and no later minor visits it again.
///
/// The address filter is NOT rebuilt here — the whole-table walk that rebuilt
/// it is exactly what this replaces. Its `false` is the only load-bearing

///
/// [`PER_OBJECT_LAYOUTS_NONEMPTY`] is a *global emptiness* proof: it turns
/// `layout_forget_object` — which runs on every allocation, every object death
/// and every relocation — into a single load whenever both side tables happen
/// to be empty. On a monomorphic workload they are empty for the entire run,
/// which is exactly what makes the accelerator worth having.
///
/// A *single* entry that is never removed converts that accelerator into
/// permanently-disabled code. #7510 already paid this once, via one interned
/// keys-array the shape cache anchored forever. The `globalThis` bootstrap is
/// the same trap at several hundred times the scale: it builds hundreds of
/// plain objects whose first pointer field mints a mask, every one of them
/// rooted at `globalThis` forever. Since a plain-object property miss forces
/// that bootstrap, *every real TypeScript program* armed the regime before
/// user code ran — measured as +28% on `churn` and +29% on `tree`, with
/// `layout_forget_object` going 112 → 916 ms and 194 → 740 ms of self time.
///
/// ## Why dropping the mask is sound
///
/// The alternative the code already uses for the very same situation — a
/// pointer stored into an object whose state is not `POINTER_FREE` — is
/// [`super::layout::GC_LAYOUT_UNKNOWN`], the tag-checked payload scan. That is
/// the universally safe state, not a weaker one; the mask is a *precision*
/// optimization that lets the collector skip known-pointer-free slots.
///
/// For an immortal object that precision buys nothing measurable: the object
/// is never reclaimed, and it is scanned only as part of the root graph. It
/// costs one tag test per slot on a few hundred objects, against two `RefCell`
/// round-trips and two hash probes on every allocation the program will ever
/// make.
///
/// ## Deliberately NOT applied to typed-shape layouts
///
/// The scope gates ONLY the mask-minting branch of `layout_note_slot`. It must
/// never redirect a *typed* layout (`init_typed_shape_layout`,
/// `layout_rebuild_from_slots`) to `GC_LAYOUT_UNKNOWN`: those describe objects
/// with raw-f64 slots, and a raw double's bit pattern can alias a heap pointer.
/// A conservative scan would then trace — and, under a copying collector,
/// *rewrite* — a slot holding a number. `GC_LAYOUT_UNKNOWN` is only safe where
/// every slot is a NaN-boxed value, which is what the mask-minting branch
/// already assumes.
