//! Policy for whole-block in-place promotion (#7742).
//!
//! The mechanism lives in `arena/promote.rs`; this is the decision layer, and
//! the decision is made from a **measurement**, not a guess.
//!
//! # The measurement
//!
//! Every copying minor already computes `live_from_bytes` — the bytes of the
//! young generation that survived — and the from-space size it started with.
//! Their ratio is the young-survival ratio. Measured on the GC benchmark set
//! (`gc-handoff/bench`, best-of-5 on the pinned M1 mini):
//!
//! | workload | copying minors | young-survival ratio |
//! |---|--:|--:|
//! | `retain`, `retain1`, `retain_wide` | 5–7 | **0.999 – 1.000** |
//! | `deeplist` | 3 | **1.000** |
//! | `churn`, `churn_alloc`, `push_cls` | 105 | 0.000 – 0.004 |
//! | `push_num`, `cycles` | 16–18 | 0.000 |
//! | `tree`, `tree_wide`, `churn_read` | 0 | — (no copying minor runs) |
//!
//! The population is bimodal with a gap of three orders of magnitude, so the
//! threshold is not a tuning knob in any interesting sense — anything in
//! `[0.01, 0.99]` classifies this set identically. It is set at
//! [`PROMOTE_SURVIVAL_THRESHOLD_PERMILLE`] = 95% purely to bound the footprint
//! cost, which is what the constant's value is actually justified against.
//!
//! # Why a per-cycle decision is safe
//!
//! A block's liveness is not knowable before the trace, and Eden blocks are
//! recycled at offset 0 so per-block history means nothing. The decision is
//! therefore per cycle, taken from the PREVIOUS cycle's ratio. The thing that
//! makes that sound rather than optimistic is that a promoting cycle **still
//! traces**, so it measures the ratio too: the feedback never goes stale, and a
//! workload that flips from live to garbage pays at most ONE nursery of
//! retained garbage before the policy turns itself off.
//!
//! Two further bounds:
//!
//! * [`PROMOTED_DEAD_BUDGET_BYTES`] caps the running total of dead bytes
//!   promoted since the last full collection. Reaching it disables in-place
//!   promotion until a full runs and actually reclaims them, so a workload
//!   that sits just above the threshold forever cannot bleed footprint
//!   indefinitely.
//! * `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` — and every mode that implies it, a resolved
//!   `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED` included — turns it off outright. Those
//!   knobs exist to make objects MOVE; a promoting cycle moves nothing, and an
//!   instrument that silently stops exercising its subject is exactly the
//!   failure mode CLAUDE.md's "a gate must assert its subject was live" rule
//!   is about.

/// # Why this is 990 and not the 999 it was introduced at (#7888)
///
/// 999 was read off `retain`/`retain_wide`/`deeplist`, whose every cycle
/// measured exactly 999 or 1000 — and **that reading was partly an artifact of
/// the flat 16 KB born-tenured threshold.** `all.push(rec)` grows its backing
/// store by doubling, and every intermediate store over 16 KB was born in
/// old-gen, so the garbage those growths abandon was never in the young
/// generation to be counted. With pointer-bearing objects nursery-resident up
/// to 128 KB the abandoned stores land where they belong, and `retain`'s FIRST
/// cycle now measures **992** — deterministically, on all four `retain*`
/// variants and on `phase_flip`. Every LATER cycle measures 1000 rather than
/// 999, i.e. the estimator is strictly more confident once the startup garbage
/// has actually been collected.
///
/// At 999 that one permille costs exactly one traced cycle per program, worth
/// `retain1` +15.7% and `retain_wide1` +11.3% on the quiet mini. The threshold
/// was over-fitted to a measurement that has since become more accurate.
