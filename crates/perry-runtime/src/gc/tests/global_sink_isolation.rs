//! #7672: the GC test guards clear process-global side tables from whatever
//! libtest thread runs them, and no reader is required to take the clearing
//! lock.
//!
//! Each probe below plants the shape that produced the three flakes of
//! 2026-08-08/09 — write on THIS thread, run the guards' clear on ANOTHER
//! thread, read back — and asserts the entry survived. That is only meaningful
//! because the same harness is shown to catch a table that has *not* been
//! converted: `the_probe_catches_a_bare_process_global_sink` runs a canary
//! declared as a plain `static` and requires the wipe to be observed. A green
//! file therefore means the detector works, not that nothing was tried.
//!
//! The probes deliberately do NOT take `crate::gc::global_side_table_test_lock()`.
//! Taking it is what the ~180 unconverted readers are not required to do, and a
//! probe that took it would be testing the opt-in rather than the isolation.
