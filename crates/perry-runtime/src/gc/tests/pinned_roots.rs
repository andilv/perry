//! A pinned object is a root, marked and traced like any other object.
//!
//! A pin means "don't move, don't sweep" — never "already marked". Each birth
//! path below builds a parent whose only child is a string, then drops every
//! root but the pin (pinned) or keeps a shadow root (unpinned control), runs a
//! collection, reallocates same-size strings over any freed cell, and reads the
//! child back through the parent. A child reached only through an untraced
//! pinned parent is freed and its cell handed back: the read-back differs.
