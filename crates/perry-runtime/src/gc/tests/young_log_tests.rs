//! #9754 — the side-table young-entry logs (`gc/young_log.rs`).
//!
//! Each table gets the same three-part proof:
//!
//! * a YOUNG entry reachable only through the table is moved by a copying
//!   minor and the entry re-keyed — through the minor-scoped walk, which the
//!   recorded walk row proves was PARTIAL (visited only the logged keys);
//! * an OLD entry is not visited at all — the row proves the skip fired
//!   (`visited == 0` while the table is non-empty), which is rule 3 of the
//!   design note: a latch that never skips looks landed while doing nothing;
//! * a DEAD young owner is pruned by the young-only prune.
//!
//! Sabotage contract (rule 2): delete any one `note` call in the tables'
//! writers and the matching "moves" test here goes red — under
//! `debug_assertions` on the log-completeness assertion the walk runs first,
//! and in release on the stale address the un-visited entry keeps.
