//! A bound TIMER-handle / TextDecoder / TextEncoder / primitive-receiver method
//! closure must not capture a pointer into the key string.
//!
//! `js_class_method_bind` stores the method-name POINTER in the closure
//! (capture 1) and `dispatch_bound_method` re-reads it at CALL time. Its
//! contract says so: "Method-name pointer is expected to be stable for the
//! closure's lifetime; codegen emits it from the per-module `.str.N.bytes`
//! rodata global."
//!
//! #7747 fixed two Buffer callers that broke it (see
//! `buffer_bound_method_name.rs`). Its commit message states the failure mode
//! exactly, and it applies verbatim here:
//!
//! > `get_field_by_name_tail` passed `key + size_of::<StringHeader>()` — the
//! > interior of a movable GC heap string that is unreachable once the read
//! > returns — so a copying minor could relocate or reclaim the bytes the
//! > closure names. […] Whether the stale bytes still spell the method is an
//! > allocator property, not a program property, which is why this passed
//! > locally and took a SIGSEGV on conformance-smoke shards 7 and 8.
//!
//! #8133 is the same defect at four more sites in the same neighbourhood, plus
//! two the issue did not name:
//!
//! * `get_field_by_name_tail.rs` — the timer-handle arm, twice (a NaN-boxed
//!   small-handle receiver and an already-stripped handle-band one).
//! * `text.rs`'s `text_handle_property` — `TextDecoder.prototype.decode` and
//!   `TextEncoder.prototype.encode`/`encodeInto` read as VALUES. That
//!   function's own docstring says value reads are the reason it exists
//!   (`K.decode.bind(K)`, "the shape a minified SDK's cached decodeText helper
//!   takes"), so this is the intended hot path, not an edge.
//! * `ic_miss.rs` — the inline-cache MISS mirror, whose own comment says "the
//!   IC fast path funnels small handles here, bypassing the identical block in
//!   `js_object_get_field_by_name`, so it must be mirrored". A separate live
//!   entry point, not a redundant copy.
//! * `get_field_by_name.rs` — a third copy of the same timer block. Fixed
//!   defensively; nothing guarantees it stays unreachable across refactors.
//! * `get_field_by_name.rs`'s primitive-number receiver — `(5).toString` and
//!   the inherited Object prototype methods used the computed key's movable
//!   interior directly (#8178).
//!
//! ## Why these assert IDENTITY and not bytes
//!
//! Quoting #7747's own testing note, which the issue repeats: the inequality
//! against the key string could pass with the bug present, and comparing the
//! BYTES only fails on a host where the freed memory has already been reused —
//! which is the lucky-allocator problem these tests exist to avoid. **Identity
//! with the literal cannot be lucky.** So every test below asserts
//! `captured_ptr == <the 'static literal>.as_ptr()`.
//!
//! A test that merely called the bound method after a collection would pass
//! with the bug fully present on any host whose allocator left the bytes
//! intact, which is precisely the test not to write.
