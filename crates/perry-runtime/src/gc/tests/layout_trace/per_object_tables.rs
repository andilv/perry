//! #7510: the emptiness flag that guards the per-object layout side tables.
//!
//! The flag's whole value is that `false` lets the allocation, store, death
//! and trace paths skip both maps. That is only sound while
//!
//!   flag == false  ⟹  both maps are empty
//!
//! holds, so these tests drive an object through every transition that can
//! populate or drain the maps and assert the implication after each one. A
//! stale `true` is merely slow and is deliberately not asserted against.
