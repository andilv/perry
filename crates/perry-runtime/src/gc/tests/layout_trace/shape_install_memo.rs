//! #7510 item 1 — the construction-side shape-install memo.
//!
//! The memo lets `js_gc_init_typed_shape_layout` skip the `SHAPE_LAYOUTS`
//! round-trip for a shape whose canonical descriptor is already installed, and
//! reduce the construction to the two header bits that install would have set.
//! Three things therefore have to be true, and each has a test here:
//!
//! 1. **It fires.** #7525's first commit was worth nothing because its fast
//!    path hit once in 40 million calls, and that was found by counting, not by
//!    reasoning. [`memo_fires_on_every_repeat_construction_of_one_shape`]
//!    counts both memo hits and authoritative descriptor probes.
//! 2. **It decides nothing.** The header declaration is re-derived from the
//!    mask words and the object's own field bits on every construction, hit or
//!    miss — [`a_memo_hit_produces_the_same_header_state_as_the_install`] and
//!    [`a_contradicting_field_is_refused_even_with_the_memo_warm`].
//! 3. **It heals.** The one transition that can falsify an entry —
//!    `SHAPE_LAYOUTS` poisoning a shape to ambiguous — drops the table:
//!    [`ambiguity_poison_invalidates_the_memo`].
//!
//! And because this is collector-facing metadata, a witness that objects built
//! through the fast path survive an evacuating minor *with their children*
//! ([`memo_installed_objects_survive_a_copying_minor_with_their_children`]),
//! next to the sabotage arm that shows what a wrong declaration would cost
//! ([`a_pointer_free_declaration_on_this_shape_strands_the_child`]).
