//! Teeth for the #7154 detection-latency instruments: from-space quarantine
//! (`PERRY_GC_PROTECT_FROMSPACE`) and GC zeal (`PERRY_GC_ZEAL`).
//!
//! Every test asserts BOTH directions of its knob. The GC knob kill-policy in
//! CLAUDE.md requires an exercised OFF state for every knob, and the reason is
//! recorded right there: `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` was inert for every
//! `gc()`-driven test for months and nobody noticed, because only the ON arm was
//! ever asserted and the ON arm did nothing.
//!
//! These are *debug instruments*, so the correctness bar is higher than usual,
//! not lower: an instrument that reports clean when the heap is dirty is worse
//! than no instrument, and one that changes the collector when it is switched
//! off is a landmine in every future bisect.
