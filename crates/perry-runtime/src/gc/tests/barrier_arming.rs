// ── #7187 Phase A: lazy barrier arming ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// Three tests, deliberately shaped as a liveness triad rather than as "nothing
// threw". CLAUDE.md's failure mode #4 — the gate runs but its subject never did
// — is the one that has cost this repo the most (`PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` was
// inert for every `gc()`-driven test for months, #6942/#6946). So each test
// asserts that the mechanism it covers was actually exercised:
//
//   1. the unarmed barrier really skipped (the log is empty for a real edge),
//   2. the reconstruct really ran and really recovered that edge (census
//      counters, plus the child ends up marked through it),
//   3. suppressing the reconstruct really loses the edge — the sabotage arm,
//      without which (1) and (2) would both pass on a fixture that never
//      produced an old→young edge at all.

/// Opens the unarmed window for THIS TEST'S THREAD ONLY and closes it on drop.
/// A global disarm would reach every concurrently-running test — measured: two
/// `gc::tests::teardown` cases went red under the default parallel run before
/// the override became thread-local. And closing on drop matters even so,
/// because libtest may reuse the thread for a later test.
