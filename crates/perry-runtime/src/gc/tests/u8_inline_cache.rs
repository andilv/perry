//! Lifecycle proof for the #9342 `PERRY_U8_INLINE_CACHE` admission cache.
//!
//! The cache contract ("an entry names a live, u8-marked, inline-storage
//! `BufferHeader`") is held up by two invalidation sites — buffer death
//! (`finalize_collected_dead_buffer`) and address re-issue
//! (`register_buffer`) — riding the same chokepoints as every other buffer
//! identity table. A stale hit is SILENT (the emitted reader would interpret
//! the new tenant's memory as `(length, bytes)`), so each site is proved here
//! by a test that fails when that specific call is removed: delete the
//! finalize call and `test_dead_u8_entry_pruned_on_full_gc` fails; delete the
//! register call and `test_reissued_address_does_not_inherit_admission`
//! fails.
