//! #6910 — the mutable-root MARK path and the mutable-root REWRITE path must
//! accept exactly the same word forms.
//!
//! Before the fix, shadow-stack slots were marked by `try_mark_value` (NaN-box
//! tags only) while `rewrite_mutable_root_slots` relocated them through
//! `try_rewrite_value` (NaN-boxed **or** bare address). A bare address in a
//! shadow slot was therefore a root to the rewrite, copying and
//! incremental-barrier paths but invisible to mark-sweep root marking — if it
//! was the only reference, the object was swept while live.
//!
//! Every test here pins the conservative native-stack scan to `Disabled`. The
//! unit-test build otherwise defaults to `Full`, whose scan accepts bare
//! addresses off the native stack and would rescue the object — which is
//! precisely why this class of bug ships green tests and a production-only
//! use-after-free (production resolves `Auto -> SkipDisabled`).
