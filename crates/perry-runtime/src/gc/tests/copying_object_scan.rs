//! The copying drain's plain-object scan (`gc/copying_object_scan.rs`) is a
//! second enumeration of an ordinary object's slots, so it is pinned three ways:
//! it is actually TAKEN by a minor over ordinary objects (a fast path nothing
//! reaches would make every other test here vacuous), every child it visits is
//! evacuated and rewritten, and a plan that drops a slot is REFUSED by the
//! generic-walk cross-check that runs in test and debug-assertion builds.
