//! #7903 — a "time-budgeted" step is only as bounded as its largest single
//! work unit.
//!
//! Two units used to be unbounded. Weak processing charged one unit per
//! registered *holder*, and a `FinalizationRegistry` is one holder however many
//! records it owns — so a single registry was an atomic, heap-sized unit behind
//! `js_gc_step_us`. Final root remark re-scans the roots and then drains
//! everything they newly reach, both with `usize::MAX`.
//!
//! These tests are adversarial in the sense the issue asked for: they build the
//! pathological shape rather than assert that an ordinary run stays quiet.
//! Every one of them asserts a **liveness counter** — that the sliced path
//! actually ran — before asserting the bound, because a run where the sliced
//! path never executed reports the same zeros as a run where it worked
//! perfectly.
