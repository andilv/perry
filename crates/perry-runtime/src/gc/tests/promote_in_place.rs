//! Teeth for whole-block in-place promotion (#7742).
//!
//! Two obligations, and the second is the one that matters:
//!
//! 1. The policy classifies the measured workload population correctly, and
//!    every knob that can turn the path off is asserted in BOTH states (the GC
//!    knob kill-policy in CLAUDE.md).
//! 2. A cycle that takes the path actually promotes something, and the
//!    promoted object comes out the far side at the SAME address, in old-gen,
//!    `GC_FLAG_TENURED`, and findable through the old-gen page index. A test
//!    that merely observes "nothing threw" would pass against a promotion that
//!    silently indexed nothing — which is precisely the shape that turns into a
//!    swept-live-object crash one cycle later.
