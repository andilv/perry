/// #8426: `String.prototype.normalize` borrowed the subject string's inline
/// WTF-8 payload BEFORE coercing its `form` argument, then read that borrow
/// after the coercion had returned.
///
/// The coercion is a collection point twice over: an inline short-string form
/// materializes onto the heap (so even `s.normalize("NFC")` allocates there),
/// and an object form runs user `toString`, whose loop back-edge polls run a
/// moving minor. Either can evacuate a young subject, and a `&str` taken
/// beforehand is a copy the collector cannot rewrite — rooting rewrites slots,
/// never already-materialized borrows. The normalization pass then read
/// retired from-space.
///
/// The test drives the object-form window, which is the one reachable from
/// user code today: `toString` forces a real copying minor. Three assertions
/// together, because any one alone can pass vacuously — (1) the subject was
/// young, (2) the collection actually MOVED it, so the window was live, and
/// (3) the normalized bytes are the subject's, not the retired page's.
///
/// `PoisonOnly` makes failure certain rather than lucky. Without it, whether a
/// stale borrow is *detected* depends on what the allocator happened to
/// recycle into the retired page; with it, those bytes are guaranteed poison.
/// The cost is the failure mode: a regression faults inside the normalization
/// pass (poison is not valid WTF-8) rather than reaching the byte assertions
/// below, so a reintroduced #8426 shows up as a SIGSEGV naming this test.
/// That is deliberate — a gate that can pass vacuously is not a gate.
