//! #7683: `js_object_clone_with_extra` published a half-built object whose
//! `keys_array` slot still held whatever the reused hole contained.
//!
//! # The hazard
//!
//! Both branches set `object_type`, `class_id`, `parent_class_id`,
//! `field_count` and `meta` immediately after allocation, then set
//! `keys_array` only at the END, via `set_object_keys_array`. In between sits
//! `crate::array::js_array_alloc`.
//!
//! That call ALLOCATES, so it can collect — and the collector reads exactly
//! this slot as a child edge (`object::gc_keys_array_slot`, enumerated by
//! `gc_child_slots`). A collection landing in that window scans a pointer the
//! mutator never wrote.
//!
//! The bytes are not zero. `arena_alloc_gc_old`'s fast path deliberately
//! reuses a swept, NON-zeroed hole (#7437: "reuse a swept same-size hole …
//! otherwise a block with any live object never yields its dead bytes back"),
//! so the slot holds real leftover heap content. Whether it happens to look
//! like a plausible-but-unmapped address depends on allocation history —
//! the shape of the ~1-in-102 `typed_feedback::object_shape` SIGSEGV in #7683.
//!
//! # Why this test is a SOURCE check and not a runtime one
//!
//! I wrote the runtime version first: force a collection into the window with
//! `force_next_general_arena_alloc_slow` + `GC_OLD_RECLAIM_PENDING`, then
//! assert the published clone's `keys_array` is sane. **It passed with the fix
//! deleted** — vacuous, and for two independent reasons. By the time the
//! function returns, `set_object_keys_array` has written the slot correctly,
//! so nothing observable survives the window; and a fresh arena block is
//! zeroed, so even inside the window the garbage would read as null unless the
//! allocation lands in a recycled old-space hole with the right history.
//!
//! Reproducing it in-suite therefore needs a specific swept-hole layout AND a
//! collection landing in a few-instruction window. That is exactly why the fix
//! is a by-construction initialisation rather than a guard — and why the test
//! that guards it asserts the invariant at the only place it is decidable: the
//! source. Same idea as `scripts/gc_pin_sites.py`'s custody check for
//! `GC_FLAG_PINNED`.

/// Every object-allocating branch of `js_object_clone_with_extra` must
/// initialise `keys_array` BEFORE the `js_array_alloc` that can collect.
