//! Idle-time old-gen compaction: the half of the idle memory story a
//! non-moving cycle cannot reach.
//!
//! [`super::idle_reclaim`] gave the collector idle time and a full budgeted
//! cycle to spend it on. That cycle sweeps: it finds the dead old-gen objects
//! and hands them to the old-gen free list. What it cannot do is give the
//! memory back, because the free list lives INSIDE partially-occupied 1 MiB
//! blocks and a non-moving sweep never empties one. Measured on the compiled
//! claude-code TUI, idle after a paste, with the reducer running:
//!
//! ```text
//! [gc] blocks: non_general=143 (130 live)   <- identical across both cycles
//! [gc-old-free] reusable_bytes=49986912 -> 50095240
//! [gc-idle-reclaim] done old_in_use=93608664->93606360 freed=2370304
//! ```
//!
//! 50 MB of a 93.6 MB old gen: swept, dead, reusable for future old-gen
//! allocation, and unreachable to the OS. Emptying those blocks needs
//! EVACUATION — moving the surviving occupants of a fragmented page out so the
//! whole block can be released — and that rides on the non-copying minor
//! (`gc/oldgen.rs`, selection in `gc/oldgen_defrag.rs`), never on a full
//! mark-sweep: `GcCycleState::new_full` takes no page selection at all.
//!
//! Two structural reasons the existing machinery never runs on this workload,
//! both of which this module has to step around rather than through:
//!
//! 1. **A budgeted cycle may not move.** `evacuation_policy_allowed =
//!    !low_pause_non_moving`, and `low_pause_non_moving` is exactly
//!    `progress_kind.is_budgeted()`. The reducer's cycle is budgeted by
//!    construction — it is stepped in 4 ms wake-checked slices — so evacuation
//!    is off in it by definition. Compaction therefore runs as its own
//!    SYNCHRONOUS collection, not as a phase of the reducer's.
//! 2. **The copying fast path consumes every ordinary minor.** Old-page defrag
//!    is only selected on the non-copying fallback, and on this workload the
//!    fast path is eligible every time (`[gc-copy-minor] eligible=true
//!    fallback=none` on all 520 minors of the session above). So the
//!    compacting collection asks for the fallback explicitly
//!    ([`super::CopyingFastPath::Skipped`]).
//!
//! # When it runs
//!
//! At the park site, after [`super::idle_reclaim`]'s full has completed — the
//! sweep is what makes a page's `dead_bytes` accounting current, and selection
//! reads exactly that. Gates, all O(1):
//!
//! 1. **Residue.** The old-gen free list holds at least
//!    [`IDLE_COMPACT_MIN_RESIDUE_BYTES`] and at least
//!    [`IDLE_COMPACT_MIN_RESIDUE_PCT`] percent of old-gen occupancy. Below
//!    that there is nothing worth a moving pause.
//! 2. **Freshness.** At least `2^backoff` reducer fulls have completed since
//!    the last compaction, so selection never runs on stale page metadata and
//!    an unproductive compaction is not retried against an unchanged heap.
//! 3. **Rate.** At least [`IDLE_COMPACT_MIN_INTERVAL_MS`] since the last one.
//!
//! **Productivity** is old-gen occupancy — `old_gen_in_use_bytes`, the sum of
//! the live blocks' bump offsets. For a SWEEP that meter is wrong and
//! [`super::idle_reclaim`] stopped using it; for compaction it is exactly
//! right, because releasing whole blocks is the only thing that moves it and
//! releasing whole blocks is the entire point. Under
//! [`IDLE_COMPACT_PRODUCTIVE_MIN_BYTES`] the requirement doubles, to
//! `2^`[`IDLE_COMPACT_MAX_BACKOFF_SHIFT`] fulls.
//!
//! # The pause
//!
//! This collection is not sliceable: a moving cycle cannot hand a half-rewritten
//! heap back to the mutator. The hook therefore checks for a pending wake
//! immediately before starting one and does not start if input is already
//! waiting — but a keystroke that lands DURING one waits for it. That pause is
//! recorded (`pause_us_max` on the diag line) rather than assumed, and the
//! residue gate is what keeps these rare: on the session above, one compaction
//! per 50 MB of accumulated free list, not one per idle period.
//!
//! # Kill switch
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_IDLE_COMPACT=0` (default ON; `env_default_on_enabled`
//! vocabulary). Note this is a DIFFERENT decision from `PERRY_GC_OLD_DEFRAG`,
//! which stays opt-in for ordinary allocation-triggered collections (#7917):
//! what changes here is that idle time — where nobody is waiting on the
//! result — pays for compaction the throughput path still declines.
