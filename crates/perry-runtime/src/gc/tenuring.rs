//! Adaptive tenuring threshold for the copying (scavenging) minor collector.
//!
//! The copying minor ages nursery survivors through the survivor semispaces
//! and promotes them to old-gen after a fixed number of copies
//! (`GC_COPY_PROMOTION_SURVIVALS`, 4). That fixed age is correct for the
//! generational-hypothesis workloads the scavenge was tuned on (tiny live
//! sets, near-empty survivor spaces) and pathological for large live sets:
//! a program whose survivors essentially never die in the survivor space
//! pays `age × influx` bytes of pure re-copying — measured 4.39 GB / 61 M
//! object-copies on a binary-tree benchmark whose entire live set was
//! ~35 MB, because the same ~3.15 MB survivor cohort ping-ponged between
//! the semispaces on every one of 1427 collections.
//!
//! This module is the survivor-occupancy feedback loop (HotSpot's adaptive
//! `TenuringThreshold`, restated for elastic semispaces). Per copying cycle
//! the collector reports the **Eden survivor influx** — bytes moved out of
//! Eden that were live (copied to a survivor space or promoted). At a
//! threshold of S survivals, steady-state survivor occupancy is
//! `(S−1) × influx` (S−1 resident age cohorts), so the next cycle's
//! threshold is the largest S whose projected occupancy fits the desired
//! survivor size:
//!
//! ```text
//! S = min(4, 1 + desired / influx)
//! ```
//!
//! `desired` is 1/16 of the scavenge nursery cap (1 MB at the default
//! 16 MB cap) — the same effective ratio HotSpot's defaults produce
//! (SurvivorRatio=8, TargetSurvivorRatio=50% ⇒ Eden/16).
//!
//! The influx signal is deliberately *threshold-invariant*: live Eden bytes
//! get moved somewhere at any S, so the feedback loop has a fixed point
//! instead of the oscillation that a post-hoc survivor-occupancy signal
//! produces (at S=1 the survivor space is empty, which would read as "no
//! pressure" and snap the threshold straight back up).
//!
//! Asymmetric response: the threshold *drops* to the computed target
//! immediately (every extra cycle at a too-high threshold re-copies the
//! whole resident cohort), but *rises* one step at a time and only after
//! the target has been above the current value for two consecutive cycles
//! (a single quiet cycle — e.g. a malloc-count trigger firing before Eden
//! filled — must not flush the aging pipeline into a copy burst).
//!
//! The occupancy rule alone is not sufficient: it optimises survivor
//! *space*, not copy *work*. A workload whose influx sits just under
//! `desired` (tree.ts measures 1,048,536 B against the 1,048,576 B
//! default — 40 bytes under) settles at S=2 and still copies every
//! surviving byte exactly once for nothing, because 100% of each cohort
//! survives its survivor round and gets promoted a cycle later anyway.
//! The **survival-rate lock** closes that: when last cycle's survivor
//! intake (`copied_bytes`) was substantial and ≥90% of it came back out
//! alive this cycle (`survivor_live_bytes`), the aging round demonstrably
//! filters nothing, so the threshold locks to 1 (promote on first copy)
//! until the influx goes quiet. The lock's exit signal — influx below
//! `desired/4` for two consecutive cycles — stays measurable while
//! locked, unlike survivor occupancy, which is zero at S=1 and would
//! leave the loop blind.
//!
//! There is no env knob here (see CLAUDE.md's GC knob kill-policy): the
//! loop is always on, and its neutral state — influx below `desired`,
//! survivor cohorts that die in place — computes S=4, which is
//! bit-for-bit the previous fixed behaviour.
//!
//! ## Seeding the lock from a non-copying collection (#7598)
//!
//! The survival-rate lock above is correct but **one cycle late by
//! construction**: it keys on `prev_copied`, so a *previous copying minor*
//! must already have filled the survivor space. On a workload with one
//! long-lived burst (`json_pipeline`: `out.push({…})` 500k times) the first
//! copying minor therefore always pays the wasted copy — measured 268 MB
//! Eden→survivor on cycle 3 and the same 268 MB survivor→old on cycle 4,
//! ~3.9 s of a 5.1 s phase spent copying one cohort twice.
//!
//! Both blind spots named on #7592 are the same shape: `retune_after_scavenge`
//! is fed **only** by copying minors, so full mark-sweeps and non-copying
//! minor fallbacks feed the loop nothing, and once a workload escalates to
//! those the loop goes blind exactly when it is needed.
//!
//! [`seed_promote_lock_from_sweep`] closes that. Every cycle that reaches the
//! mark-sweep path — a full, or a non-copying minor fallback — already walks
//! every Eden header and classifies it live or dead. That walk yields the two
//! numbers the lock wants, one collection *earlier* than the survivor
//! round-trip can produce them.
//!
//! ### Why this signal is not a fixed point of the policy reading it
//!
//! This issue has already produced three self-referential signals, so the
//! argument is spelled out rather than assumed:
//!
//! * The Eden-side probe reached for `promoted_bytes`, which is **zero by
//!   construction at S=4** — "was the promotion rate high?" can never answer
//!   yes while S=4 holds, so it could never leave S=4.
//! * #7596's first nursery cap gated from-space occupancy on a total that
//!   *included* from-space, so the cap was a bound from-space could never
//!   cross and scavenging stopped entirely.
//! * #7594's handoff scheduled a *non-moving* full to relieve pressure only a
//!   *moving* cycle can relieve, so the predicate was true again next cycle.
//!
//! The Eden live/dead split has none of that structure. It is produced by the
//! mark-sweep's own arena walk: marks come from reachability from roots, and
//! neither the mark phase nor the walk reads `tenuring_survivals()` — the
//! threshold is consulted only by `copying.rs`'s per-object move, which this
//! path does not run. Concretely, at both endpoints the signal stays
//! measurable and keeps its meaning:
//!
//! | state | what Eden holds at the sweep | signal |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | S=4 (state to leave) | everything that has not aged out | high live fraction on a retaining workload ⇒ says "lock" |
//! | S=1 (state to stay in) | only Eden allocated since the last promotion | still the mutator's retention of recent Eden ⇒ still measurable |
//!
//! Exit is deliberately **not** this signal. Entering hands over to the
//! existing `PROMOTE_LOCK`, whose unlock condition (Eden influx below
//! `desired/4` for two consecutive copying minors) is already
//! threshold-invariant and already tested — so the seed cannot introduce an
//! enter/exit oscillation of its own.
//!
//! ### Determinism (#7432)
//!
//! #7432 forbids re-deciding S *while objects are being moved*: the
//! copied/promoted split would then depend on root traversal order. The seed
//! is written at the END of a completed sweep and read at the ENTRY of a later
//! copying minor (`CopyingNurseryCollector::new` snapshots it once), so every
//! object in a cycle still sees exactly one threshold and the counters stay a
//! pure function of (heap state at entry, threshold at entry).
//!
//! Two exclusions at the callsite keep the *input* deterministic too, and both
//! are refusals rather than tuning:
//!
//! * **Budgeted cycles.** Whole-cycle allocate-black marks every mid-cycle
//!   birth, and this walk reads MARKED as live — a churn workload's births
//!   would read as a ~100% live Eden. Same reason the age-bump is suppressed
//!   there (`cycle.rs`).
//! * **Cycles that ran the conservative native-stack scan.** That scan retains
//!   whatever the stack happens to look like a pointer to, by an amount that
//!   varies run to run (`benchmarks/gc_ratchet/README.md`). A liveness
//!   *measurement* taken under it is not sound, and feeding it into a policy
//!   would make the gated copy/promote counters non-deterministic.
