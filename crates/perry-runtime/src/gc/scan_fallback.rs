//! Conservative-scan fallback accounting and the safepoint-deferral counters
//! that make "the fallback never fires" a *measured* statement (#7148).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! `ManualGcScanGuard::force_full_scan()` pins this thread's conservative
//! native-stack scan on for the duration of one collection. That is sound —
//! it retains anything reachable from a register or an unspilled native local
//! — but it is *catastrophically* expensive, and the cost is not a slowdown:
//! a conservative scan makes the copying minor ineligible
//! (`CopiedMinorFallbackReason::ConservativeStack`), so a cycle that takes it
//! runs **no copying minor at all**. `benchmarks/gc_ratchet/README.md`
//! measures the end-to-end effect of scanning on the eight ratchet probes:
//! `heap_used_bytes` +364% to +5371%, and `minor_cycles` → **0 on all eight**.
//!
//! So every `force_full_scan()` that fires is a collection that reclaims by
//! sweeping instead of by evacuating, on a heap that has retained everything
//! the native stack happened to look like a pointer to.
//!
//! # The rule
//!
//! Before #7148 there were six `force_full_scan()` sites and no way to tell,
//! for any given program, whether any of them ever ran. "It never fires in
//! practice" was an assumption. Per CLAUDE.md's four-ways-a-gate-cannot-fail
//! rule — *a gate must assert its subject was live* — an unobservable fallback
//! is indistinguishable from a fallback that fires on every cycle.
//!
//! Every site therefore records itself here, and the two *deferral* paths that
//! replace a scan with a precise safepoint collection record themselves too.
//! A test or a benchmark can now assert both halves of the claim:
//!
//! * the conservative fallback did **not** fire (`scan_fallback_count`), and
//! * the precise safepoint collection that replaced it **did**
//!   (`safepoint_drain_count`) — not merely that nothing crashed.
//!
//! # Relationship to the explicit-safepoint contract
//!
//! The statepoint experiment (`exp/stackmap-viability`,
//! `docs/statepoint-gc-experiment.md`) states the invariant this instrument
//! measures compliance with: *a collection that skips the conservative stack
//! scan consumes only precise roots, so it may only begin at a declared
//! safepoint (a loop back-edge poll or the outermost microtask-pump
//! boundary); anywhere else it must scan conservatively.* That experiment
//! enforces the invariant with a thread-local declared-safepoint flag plus a
//! check at the root-scan subphase, in two levels (heal / strict panic).
//!
//! This module is the *reachability census* for the same contract on `main`:
//! it counts the sites where the contract's "anywhere else" arm is taken.
//! Driving those counts to zero is what makes the conservative scanner
//! deletable; the contract's enforcement check is what makes zero *provable*
//! rather than observed. The two compose — census first, enforcement second.
