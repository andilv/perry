//! Whole-heap from-space scan (#7035).
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_VERIFY_EVACUATION` walks the same surfaces the *rewrite pass*
//! walks — `visit_shadow_stack_root_slots`, `visit_global_root_slots`, and the
//! registered side-table scanners. Both derive from one enumeration, so the
//! verifier can only check that the rewrite pass agreed with itself: a holder
//! the rewrite pass never knew about is invisible to the verifier too. On the
//! #7022 reproducer the verifier reports clean while the program dies of malloc
//! heap corruption, which is exactly that blind spot.
//!
//! This pass takes the opposite approach and asks a question that does not
//! depend on any root enumeration:
//!
//! > After the rewrite pass, does any live object OUTSIDE from-space still
//! > contain a word that decodes to a from-space address?
//!
//! It answers it by walking the whole heap — the arena census (`Address`-order
//! `ArenaObjectCursor`, covering Eden / both survivor semispaces / old / long-
//! lived) plus the malloc-tracked registry — and decoding every payload word
//! through `decode_root_word`, the same decoder the mark and rewrite paths
//! share (#6910). Objects that are themselves in from-space are skipped: they
//! are about to be reclaimed, and a dead object legitimately still points at
//! its dead peers.
//!
//! A word whose target carries `GC_FLAG_FORWARDED` is an unambiguous **missing
//! rewrite**: the object moved this cycle and this reference was not updated.
//! A word pointing at a non-forwarded from-space object is a **dangling**
//! reference — the target was not evacuated at all, so it is about to be
//! recycled underneath this holder.
//!
//! # Cost and placement
//!
//! O(live heap) per collection, so it is strictly a debug instrument behind
//! `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN=1`. It must run after the rewrite pass and
//! **before** `copying_reset_from_spaces_and_flip`, while from-space is still
//! intact and page-registered — the same window the evacuation verifier uses.
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_FROMSPACE_SCAN_ABORT=1` additionally aborts on the first offender
//! so a debugger/crash report captures the offending cycle rather than the
//! downstream corruption.
