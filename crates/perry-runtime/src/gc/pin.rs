//! `GC_FLAG_PINNED` custody, and the young-pin latch the copying minor's
//! eligibility preflight is skipped on (#7645).
//!
//! # Why this module exists
//!
//! The copying minor traverses the young object graph **twice**: once in
//! `CopiedMinorEligibility::evaluate`'s preflight, to prove nothing reachable
//! is pinned, and again to copy. On `json_pipeline` the first traversal is
//! ~22% of the hot phase and produces no collection result at all.
//!
//! The preflight walk (`CopyingNurseryPreflight::drain`) answers exactly two
//! questions:
//!
//! 1. Is any transitively reachable `Eden`/`FromSurvivor` object
//!    `GC_FLAG_PINNED`? (`check_ptr_with_reason`)
//! 2. Was a non-arena candidate seen while the malloc registry was
//!    unavailable and non-empty at cycle start?
//!    (`classify_for_preflight`)
//!
//! (2) is already decidable in O(1) from `CopyingPointerSet`'s two fields.
//! (1) is O(live young graph) — but only because it *searches* for a fact that
//! can instead be *recorded at the moment it is created*. That is what this
//! module does: every write of `GC_FLAG_PINNED` goes through [`pin_object`],
//! which arms a process-wide monotone latch when (and only when) the pinned
//! object is in a space the copying minor would relocate.
//!
//! When the latch is clear, no object anywhere carries a young pin, so the
//! walk provably returns `None` and skipping it is observationally equivalent
//! (modulo the layout/malloc-lookup telemetry counters the walk incremented).
//! Note the direction: "no young pinned object exists at all" is *stronger*
//! than the walk's "no young pinned object is reachable", so the substitution
//! is conservative, not merely equal.
//!
//! # The safety argument, and what enforces it
//!
//! Skipping this guard is a use-after-move if it is ever wrong: `move_young`
//! relocates a pinned object exactly as it would any other (it only *preserves*
//! the bit, `copying.rs`), and the raw `usize` in `PENDING_THREAD_RESULTS` has
//! no scanner to rewrite. So the latch's completeness is load-bearing and is
//! enforced three ways, not asserted in prose:
//!
//! * **Statically, at every write site.** `scripts/gc_pin_sites.py` (run in
//!   `lint`) fails on any source line that sets the pinned bit outside
//!   [`pin_object`], and equally on an allowlist entry that no longer matches
//!   anything. It deliberately matches both the named-constant form
//!   (`gc_flags |= GC_FLAG_PINNED`) and the raw-byte form
//!   (`*gc_flags_ptr |= 0x04`) — two of the six pin sites that existed when
//!   this landed used the raw byte and are invisible to a
//!   `grep GC_FLAG_PINNED`.
//! * **Dynamically, at the moment it would matter.** `move_young` checks the
//!   pinned bit on the flags byte it has already loaded, and aborts if a
//!   *preflight-skipped* cycle is about to relocate a pinned object. That is
//!   the precise instant an incomplete latch becomes memory corruption, and it
//!   costs one `and` plus a never-taken branch.
//! * **In tests.** The copying suite's pinned-fallback tests plant their pins
//!   through [`pin_object`], so deleting the arming below turns them red
//!   rather than leaving them green on an unsound configuration.
//!
//! # Why the latch is monotone
//!
//! A decrementing counter would recover the fast path after a transient pin
//! (a settled `fetch` promise, say). It was rejected for this change because
//! it adds a *second* completeness obligation of the same severity: every
//! unpin site must also be complete, and a spurious or double decrement is
//! silently unsound in exactly the same use-after-move way. Monotone needs one
//! proof. A process that has ever pinned young pays the walk forever, which is
//! the conservative direction.
//!
//! Concretely, the pin sites that arm the latch in production are the
//! Eden-resident ones — `js_promise_new()` promises pinned for native
//! resolution (`perry-stdlib`'s `async_bridge`, i.e. fetch/zlib/ws/bcrypt),
//! `Atomics.waitAsync`, and the AppKit text reads. Programs that use them get
//! today's behaviour; compute- and JSON-shaped programs get the walk removed.
