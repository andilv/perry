//! Seeded GC-schedule fuzzing (#7154 tooling) — `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED`.
//!
//! # Why the collection schedule is a knob at all
//!
//! A #7154-class bug is a value that is live but not rooted across a collection
//! point. Whether it is *caught* depends entirely on whether a collection lands
//! inside that window, so the observed failure rate is a property of the
//! *schedule*, not of the bug. Normal pacing puts collections tens of megabytes
//! apart: Socket Firewall's `sfw-registry --help` fails about 1 run in 60 there.
//! Confirming a fix by repetition at that rate needs ~1000 runs; with zero
//! failures in `N` runs the 95% upper bound on the true rate is only ~`3/N`, so
//! 120 clean runs bound a 1.7% bug at 2.5% — no evidence at all.
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED=<u64>` makes the decision *"should this safepoint
//! collect?"* a deterministic pseudo-random function of the seed and a
//! monotonically increasing per-thread safepoint counter, at a density
//! `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE` tunes (default 5%). The whole range is one knob:
//! rate 1 collects at *every* handled safepoint — maximum pressure, one fixed
//! schedule, slow, and distorting enough that some workloads never reach the
//! interesting code (on Socket Firewall's registry a rate-1 run dies in
//! `node-machine-id` first, so the useful rates there are the low ones). Two
//! properties follow from the seed, and they are the whole point:
//!
//! 1. **Amplification.** Varying *when* collections fire explores the actual bug
//!    space. Re-running one fixed schedule explores almost nothing — which is
//!    why 60 identical runs find the same bug once.
//! 2. **A failing seed is a reproducer.** The schedule is a pure function of
//!    `(seed, counter)`. Same seed + same program + same inputs ⇒ same
//!    collection schedule, run to run. A fuzzer that finds a bug and loses the
//!    reproducer is worthless, so the seed is also printed on startup and again
//!    on any crash, abort or panic.
//!
//! # What the knobs actually gate
//!
//! Per CLAUDE.md's GC-knob policy, precisely:
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED=<u64>` (unset ⇒ mode OFF, and OFF is inert):
//!
//! 1. `js_gc_loop_safepoint` stops requiring `GC_SAFEPOINT_PENDING` before it
//!    descends into `gc_safepoint_moving_minor`. The schedule cannot select a
//!    safepoint that the gate returned from.
//! 2. In `gc_safepoint_moving_minor`, the per-thread safepoint counter is
//!    advanced once per *handled* safepoint (i.e. after the entry guards, at the
//!    point `GC_SAFEPOINT_PENDING` is cleared), and when
//!    `gc_budgeted_due_trigger()` reports nothing due, a minor is run anyway iff
//!    the schedule selected this counter value.
//! 3. `gc_force_evacuate_enabled()` becomes true, so a scheduled minor **moves**
//!    survivors instead of sweeping in place. Without this the mode would be a
//!    knob whose name promises relocation stress and whose effect is sweep
//!    pressure — the failure `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` already cost this project
//!    once (#6942 / #6946).
//!
//! It does **not**:
//!
//! - bypass `gc_safepoint_moving_minor`'s entry guards. A safepoint reached
//!   mid-allocation (`GC_FLAG_IN_ALLOC`), suppressed (`GC_FLAG_SUPPRESSED`),
//!   inside an unsafe FFI zone, under a non-zero `GC_ROOT_LOCK_DEPTH`, or during
//!   a budgeted cycle still returns without collecting **and without ticking the
//!   counter**, so the schedule stays aligned with safepoints that could have
//!   collected;
//! - leave survivors in place: a resolved seed implies forced evacuation
//!   UNCONDITIONALLY. `PERRY_GEN_GC_EVACUATE`, whose `=0` used to veto that,
//!   was deleted by #7611 precisely because an ambient veto silently turned
//!   the #7154 instrument into a no-op — the vacuous-green shape the knob
//!   kill-policy exists to catch;
//! - emit loop back-edge polls. Those are a **compile-time** property
//!   (`PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS`, default ON since #7721; a binary compiled
//!   with `=0` has none). Without them the mode only sees event-loop-boundary
//!   safepoints and a compute-only loop never collects — check the exit
//!   summary's `loop_polls=` before trusting a clean sweep;
//! - suppress or replace pressure-driven collections. The rate is *additional*
//!   density on top of what the budgeted collector already does, never less.
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_RATE=<float in [0,1]>` (default `0.05`) gates **only** the
//! threshold the schedule hash is compared against — the expected fraction of
//! handled safepoints at which a collection is forced. It is inert unless
//! `PERRY_GC_SCHEDULE_SEED` is set. `0` means never (a deliberately inert-but-on
//! configuration, useful as a control: the banner and reporter still install, so
//! an A/B against `rate>0` isolates the schedule from the reporting). `1` means
//! every handled safepoint — the maximum-pressure endpoint, where the seed stops
//! mattering because every ordinal is selected whatever it hashes to.
//!
//! # Determinism: the guarantee, and its limit
//!
//! The decision function is `schedule_hit(seed, counter, threshold)`: two rounds
//! of SplitMix64 over `(seed, counter)`. It reads **no** wall-clock time, **no**
//! address, **no** allocation state, and **no** thread identity. So for a
//! single-threaded program the schedule is reproducible run to run given the
//! same seed, binary and inputs.
//!
//! **The counter is thread-local, and that is the honest scope of the
//! guarantee.** Each thread in a `perry/thread` program has its own arena and
//! its own collector, and its own counter starting at zero; each thread's
//! schedule is therefore deterministic *given that thread's own sequence of
//! handled safepoints*. What is not guaranteed is that a multi-threaded program
//! executes the same sequence of safepoints per thread on every run — that
//! depends on OS scheduling, which this mode does not control and does not
//! pretend to. A global atomic counter would be strictly worse: it would make
//! even each individual thread's schedule depend on interleaving. So:
//! **deterministic for single-threaded programs; per-thread deterministic, but
//! not run-to-run reproducible, for multi-threaded ones.** Programs that read
//! the clock, the network or the filesystem are of course only as reproducible
//! as those inputs.
