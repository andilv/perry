//! GC zeal mode (#7154 tooling) — `PERRY_GC_ZEAL`.
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! A #7154-class bug is a value that is live but not rooted across a collection
//! point. Whether it is *caught* depends entirely on whether a collection
//! happens to land inside that window. In a normal run the window is a few
//! instructions wide and collections are tens of megabytes apart, so the bug is
//! observed only when an unrelated allocation burst lines up with it — which is
//! why the #7154 hunt needed a `zod` workload and ten rounds.
//!
//! Zeal removes the coincidence. Modelled on V8's `--stress-scavenge` and
//! SpiderMonkey's `gcZeal`, it forces an **evacuating** minor at every GC
//! safepoint, so an unrooted value moves on its FIRST exposure, deterministically.
//!
//! # What the knob actually gates
//!
//! `PERRY_GC_ZEAL=1`:
//!
//! 1. Every loop back-edge poll (`js_gc_loop_safepoint`) runs a minor, instead
//!    of only draining an already-deferred one (`GC_SAFEPOINT_PENDING`).
//! 2. Every outermost microtask-pump safepoint runs a minor, instead of only
//!    when `gc_budgeted_due_trigger()` reports nursery/old pressure.
//! 3. `gc_force_evacuate_enabled()` becomes true, so the minor **moves** every
//!    marked non-pinned nursery object rather than leaving survivors in place.
//!    Without this a zealous minor could run and move nothing, which would be a
//!    gate that cannot fail.
//!
//! It does **not** change which collections are *sound* — every forced
//! collection runs at a point the collector already treats as a precise-root
//! safepoint. It only changes how often.
//!
//! ## Point 1 requires a compile-time opt-in too
//!
//! Loop back-edge polls are only *emitted* when the compiler ran with
//! `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1` (default off since #7161). Zeal cannot
//! conjure a poll that codegen never emitted. A binary compiled without polls
//! still gets (2) and (3) — event-loop-boundary zeal — but a compute-only loop
//! that never yields will not collect at all. **For the #7154 hunt, compile AND
//! run with `PERRY_GC_MOVING_LOOP_POLLS=1`.**
//!
//! Codegen also emits no poll for a provably alloc-free loop body (by design —
//! `loop_purity::loop_may_allocate`) nor for the specialized `for` / `for-of` /
//! `for-in` lowerings (by omission — `emit_gc_loop_safepoint`'s COVERAGE note),
//! so "I passed the flag" is not the same claim as "my loop has a poll".
//!
//! ## You do not have to remember to check any of this (#7604)
//!
//! A zeal run prints its own verdict at the process-exit boundary and **exits
//! 70** when it exercised nothing — see `zeal_verdict`. Before that, the
//! liveness counter this module exposes was unreadable from a compiled program
//! and the documented check could not be performed.
//!
//! # Why there is no allocation-point level
//!
//! An obvious `PERRY_GC_ZEAL=2` would collect at every allocation. It was
//! deliberately not implemented: the allocation-point arm in `gc_check_trigger`
//! takes `ManualGcScanGuard::force_full_scan`, and a forced conservative stack
//! scan makes the copying minor ineligible
//! (`CopiedMinorFallbackReason::ConservativeStack`). A level 2 would therefore
//! run many *non-moving* minors and move nothing — a knob whose name promises
//! relocation stress and whose effect is sweep pressure. That is precisely the
//! failure `PERRY_GC_FORCE_EVACUATE` already cost this project once (#6942 /
//! #6946), so the level does not exist rather than existing untrustworthy.

// ★ `zeal_forced_collections()` above was, until #7604, UNREADABLE from a

// `crate::gc::zeal_forced_collections()` is nonzero" and there was no JS API,
// no diagnostic line and no exit report through which to do so. The only
// alternative — `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1` and grep — wrote **212 MB of stderr in ten
// minutes** on a 400k-iteration ratchet probe, so it is not a usable check
// either. A liveness counter nobody can read is the same thing as no liveness
// counter.
//
// Two more counters are needed alongside it, because "zeal forced a collection"
// and "a collection MOVED something" are different claims and only the second
// one is what zeal exists to produce. A forced minor can still be escalated to
// a full mark-sweep by the throughput-pacing predicates, and a full sweep moves
// nothing — which is #7604's "zero copying minors" in one sentence.
//
