//! Validation for the *target* of a forwarding pointer (#8174).
//!
//! `GC_FLAG_FORWARDED` says "the first payload word of this object is the
//! address it moved to". Both forwarding walkers —
//! [`CopyingNurseryCollector::rewrite_raw_addr`](super::copying) and
//! [`try_rewrite_raw_addr`](super::verify) — used to trust that word
//! unconditionally: whatever it held became the answer, and if it did not
//! classify as heap the walk simply *stopped there* and returned it.
//!
//! That is safe for a slot the collector already proved is a live reference,
//! and it is not safe for a **metadata key** (`RuntimeRootVisitor::
//! visit_metadata_*`), which is deliberately NOT a root: its object may have
//! died, the arena may have recycled the address, and the recycled payload
//! bytes then get read as a `GcHeader`. #8040 hit exactly that — recycled
//! bytes with `gc_flags = 0x86` (`GC_FLAG_FORWARDED` set), `obj_type = 104`,
//! whose "forwarding pointer" was a NaN-boxed value (`0x7FFF…`). The walk
//! stopped after one hop and returned it; the caller masked it to 48 bits and
//! got a live, unrelated survivor. The class id of a synthetic class was then
//! bound to an interned string, and the program failed several collections
//! later with `TypeError: value is not a function`.
//!
//! #8168 removed the one dead key that reached this. This module removes the
//! *following*: a forwarding target that is not the start of a heap object is
//! refused outright rather than returned as an address.
