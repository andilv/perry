//! #9486 — real, named frames in `Error.prototype.stack`.
//!
//! Split out of `error.rs` to keep that file under the 2,000-line CI cap
//! (`scripts/check_file_size.sh`); included from there with
//! `#[path = "error_stack_frames.rs"] mod stack_frames;`, so `use super::*`
//! resolves against `error.rs`.
//!
//! # What was broken
//!
//! `current_stack_frame()` produced exactly one line — `    at <anonymous>`
//! outside a `--debug-symbols` build — because nothing ever looked at the
//! native stack. Node prints the real call chain, so every `err.stack` a
//! compiled app rendered (cc's `doctor`, commander's parse-error report) lost
//! its diagnostic content entirely.
//!
//! # The two halves, and why each one is the cheap one
//!
//! **Capture** is a frame-pointer chain walk. Codegen tags every generated
//! function `"frame-pointer"="non-leaf"` (`perry-codegen/src/function.rs`),
//! which is the same property the collector's own `fp_chain` walker relies on
//! (`gc/roots/stack_maps.rs`), so `[fp] = caller fp` / `[fp+8] = return
//! address` holds for JS frames on both supported architectures. Two loads per
//! frame, no allocation, no symbolication — and it runs on EVERY `new Error`,
//! including the overwhelming majority whose `.stack` is never read.
//!
//! **Resolution** happens on first `.stack` read and reuses the registry
//! codegen already fills: `js_register_function_name_static` records
//! `(compiled address, JS display name)` once per function in
//! `__perry_init_strings_*` (72,713 entries for the claude-code bundle) so
//! `fn.name` and `[Function: f]` work. That table is keyed by exact function
//! address; a return address points into the MIDDLE of a function, so this
//! module snapshots it into an address-sorted vector once and answers
//! containment with a binary search.
//!
//! # Why the frames are named but not positioned
//!
//! A `file:line:col` would need a per-return-address line table — an
//! O(instructions) artifact, against this one's O(functions). The issue's bar
//! is frame COUNT and NAMES; positions are explicitly not byte-compared
//! against node. A resolved frame renders as `    at name (<anonymous>)` —
//! V8's own spelling for a frame whose script position is unknown, and the
//! shape the stack-parsing libraries in real bundles expect.
