//! turnloop P1: Perry's stream networking on turnloop handles
//! (DESIGN §12 "P1", §5a.5, and the P1 row of the migration audit).
//!
//! P0 handed turnloop only the *wait*. P1 hands it the sockets: a TCP or local
//! listener, its multishot accept, every accepted connection, every client
//! connect, the reads, the writes, the write-side shutdown and the close all
//! become operations on the primary agent's `turnloop::Loop`. What that
//! deletes on the caller's side is one tokio task per listener, one per
//! connection, and the per-socket `mpsc` command channel those tasks selected
//! on (`perry-ext-net/src/lib.rs`'s `run_socket_task`).
//!
//! # Why the core lives here and not in the `net` binding
//!
//! The loop is per agent and thread-local, and perry-runtime owns it
//! (`event_pump/agent_loop.rs`). A binding crate is a separately linked
//! `staticlib` with no Cargo edge to perry-runtime, so it cannot hold a
//! `&mut Loop`. Everything that must touch the driver therefore lives here,
//! and the bindings reach it through the C ABI in [`abi`] (perry-ffi wraps
//! that for ext crates the same way it wraps the event pump).
//!
//! # Completion routing
//!
//! turnloop is pull-based (DESIGN D1): nothing is called from inside the
//! driver. `agent_loop` turns the loop, drains the completion buffer, and only
//! then calls [`dispatch`], which routes each completion to the *subsystem*
//! that submitted it. A subsystem registers one sink plus one id allocator
//! ([`register_sink`]); the allocator exists because an accepted connection is
//! a resource turnloop creates, and the id space it must be named in belongs
//! to the binding (`perry_ffi::reserve_handle_id_in_domain`).
//!
//! Routing needs no side table: the submission `Token` *is* the route. Its top
//! 8 bits are the operation class and its low 56 bits are the Perry-side id,
//! so a completion identifies its socket and its syscall without a lookup, and
//! a stale token from a closed socket finds no entry and is dropped.
//!
//! # GC
//!
//! **No JS heap memory is ever handed to the driver.** Reads land in
//! turnloop's own pooled buffers and are copied into JS values by the sink,
//! on the owning thread, inside the dispatch call; writes arrive as an owned
//! `Vec<u8>` the caller already copied out of the JS value (which is what
//! `perry-ext-net`'s `jsvalue_to_socket_bytes` has always done). So there is
//! no buffer to root across a collection and no pointer for a moving
//! collector to invalidate — strictly stronger than the "root from submit to
//! completion" rule in DESIGN D3, and it is the reason this module registers
//! no GC root scanner. The JS-side records (listener closures, completion
//! callbacks) stay where they are, under the binding's existing scanner.
//!
//! Exactly-once release (DESIGN D4) is what makes that safe to *state*: every
//! accepted operation ends in exactly one terminal completion, and the entry —
//! with its queued writes — is dropped only when the handle's final `Closed`
//! arrives.
