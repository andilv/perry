//! Owner of the JSON tape's backing bytes (#7539).
//!
//! A `LazyArrayHeader` used to be allocated as ONE arena object with its tape
//! copied inline after the header. For the 10 k-record `field_access` fixture
//! that is ~2.4 MB in a single allocation, which puts it over
//! `LARGE_OBJECT_THRESHOLD_BYTES` (16 KB), so `arena_alloc_gc` routed the whole
//! thing straight into the OLD generation with `GC_FLAG_TENURED` set. Old-gen
//! bytes are reclaimable only by a FULL collection, so a tape that dies at the
//! end of its loop iteration still accumulated at ~2.4 MB per parse until
//! `old_reclaim_pressure_due` fired (48 MB absolute / 32 MB growth).
//!
//! Measured at `origin/main` on the `bench_field_access.ts` fixture
//! (`PERRY_GC_TRACE=1`, 53 parses): 19 collections, 9 of them full, **6 of
//! those triggered by `old_gen_bytes`**. With `PERRY_JSON_TAPE=0` the same
//! program runs 14 collections with 5 fulls and only 2 `old_gen_bytes`
//! triggers. The cleanest attribution is `bench.ts` (roundtrip), which never
//! materialises anything: its nursery peaks at 4.1 MB while the OLD generation
//! peaks at **39.6 MB** and fires 5 `old_gen_bytes` fulls — in that program the
//! old generation *is* the tape.
//!
//! So the tape moves out of the GC heap entirely. It is a legitimate side
//! allocation by every test the runtime already applies to `Map`/`Set` entry
//! buffers:
//!
//! * **Pointer-free by construction.** `TapeEntry` is `{ offset: u32, kind:
//!   u8, link: u32 }` — three integer fields, two of which are too narrow to
//!   hold a 48-bit heap address, and the only writer of the region is one
//!   `copy_nonoverlapping` from a `&[TapeEntry]`. It therefore never needs
//!   scanning, marking, or rewriting.
//! * **Uniquely owned.** Exactly one `LazyArrayHeader` references a tape and
//!   nothing else can, so ownership is exact and needs no tracing.
//! * **Immutable and immovable after construction.**
//!
//! Lifetime is the proven Map/Set side-allocation shape, keyed by the owning
//! header's address:
//!
//! * [`register`] at construction, [`release`] when the owner dies.
//! * `GcFinalizeHookKind::LazyArrayTape` covers the non-copying sweeps.
//! * [`finalize_dead_copied_minor_from_space_lazy_arrays`] covers the copying
//!   minor, whose bulk from-space reset skips per-object finalizers.
//! * [`release_current_thread_lazy_tapes`] at thread teardown.
//!
//! There is deliberately no move hook and no copied-minor from-space pass: the
//! owning header stays OLD-GEN and immovable (see
//! `json_tape::alloc_lazy_header_bytes`), so its address is stable for its
//! whole life and it never appears in a from-space. Shrinking the header into
//! the nursery instead would have made it movable for the first time and broke
//! `json::stringify_api::try_stringify_lazy_array`, which reads `blob_bytes`
//! off a raw header and then allocates.
//!
//! On top of that the owner can disown its tape *deterministically*: once
//! `force_materialize_lazy` installs `materialized`, the tape is provably
//! garbage (every subsequent read goes through the `ArrayHeader`), so
//! `json_tape::release_tape_after_materialize` frees it right there without
//! waiting for any collector. That is the path `field_access` takes after
//! #7537's scan flip, which is why the fix does not depend on GC timing for
//! the workload that motivated it.
