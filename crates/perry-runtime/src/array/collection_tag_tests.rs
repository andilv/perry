//! Receiver-tag gating of the `Map`/`Set` registry probes (#7765).
//!
//! `js_array_get_f64` and `js_array_length` used to ask both collection
//! registries "is this receiver a Set? a Map?" on every element read of an
//! ordinary array. Once a program creates one `Map` the #7474 monotone latch is
//! armed and both probes are real work — a thread-local resolution plus a hash,
//! per read, to prove an array is not a Map. They are now gated on the
//! receiver's own `GcHeader.obj_type`.
//!
//! These tests assert THE SUBJECT, not just the answer. The registry is a
//! correct fallback, so a test that only compared values would still pass with
//! the gate deleted — case 4 of CLAUDE.md's "four ways a gate can be unable to
//! fail". `TEST_{MAP,SET}_REGISTRY_PROBES` count every entry into
//! `is_registered_map` / `is_registered_set`, and the plain-array case asserts
//! those counters do not move. Delete either gate and that assertion fails.
//!
//! The ABA case has its own test. The tag is ABA-proof because it lives INSIDE
//! the candidate bytes: whatever allocation owns those bytes next stamps its own
//! `obj_type` through `arena_alloc_gc` before the pointer is handed out, so a
//! recycled address answers for its new owner. That is the property an
//! address-keyed negative memo could not have (#7755), and
//! `a_stale_registry_entry_over_recycled_bytes_does_not_read_as_a_map` plants
//! exactly that state.
