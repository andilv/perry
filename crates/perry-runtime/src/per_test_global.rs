//! `per_test_global!` — a process-global table whose test-time isolation no
//! lock enforces, declared so that one test cannot reach another test's copy.
//!
//! The macro is named for what it *does* (a per-test instance in a test build)
//! rather than for the sharpest instance of the hazard (the GC guards' clear),
//! because two of its residents are not cleared by anything:
//!
//! * `tui::tree`'s `NEXT_HANDLE` / `REGISTRY` — no clear at all, just two
//!   process-global counters and `assert_eq!(h2, h1 + 1)`. A concurrent
//!   `register()` on any other test thread breaks it.
//! * `gc::barrier`'s `GENERATED_WRITE_BARRIERS_EMITTED` — owned by TWO guards
//!   under TWO DIFFERENT locks, and read by tests holding neither.
//!
//! Both of those failed inside a 22-run soak of the fix for the first case, and
//! both were diagnosed from the wrong VALUE rather than the timing (a
//! non-sequential handle; `slot_page_ever_dirty=false`, i.e. the barrier did not
//! fire). Naming the macro after the clear would have made them look like
//! misfits rather than the same defect.
//!
//! # The defect this exists to make structurally impossible (#7672)
//!
//! `gc::tests::support::reset_copying_nursery_runtime_test_state()` runs from
//! `GcTestIsolationGuard` and `CopyingNurseryTestGuard`, and calls ~20
//! `test_clear_*` helpers so the GC test that constructed the guard sees
//! exactly the roots it installs. Those helpers `clear()` PROCESS-global
//! tables, from whatever libtest thread happens to be running the guard.
//!
//! The guards serialize against *each other* (`global_side_table_test_lock`),
//! and against the handful of tests that remember to take that lock. Nothing
//! requires a *reader* to take it — the defence is opt-in and the opt-in is
//! invisible at the read site. So a test on thread T that writes an entry and
//! reads it back a few statements later has its entry deleted, mid-test, by a
//! guard on thread U, and observes a silently wrong value.
//!
//! Three flakes in two days came from exactly this, each diagnosed from the
//! wrong VALUE rather than the timing:
//!
//! | fixed in | table | presented as |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | #7665 | `opt_report`'s row sink | `rows.len() == 2` failing at **3** |
//! | #7665 | `ext_registry`'s `USED_PROVIDERS` | "empty" failing with `ioredis` present |
//! | #7671 | `closure`'s `CLOSURE_PROPS` | a static method read back as `TAG_UNDEFINED` |
//!
//! # Why the fix is per-thread storage and not a lock
//!
//! The damage window is "between this test's write and this test's read", and
//! only the test knows that span. An accessor that takes a shared lock for the
//! duration of one call does not cover it; a lock that covers it has to be
//! taken by the test, which is the opt-in the class is made of. Blanket-locking
//! the ~180 tests that read these tables serializes a large part of the suite
//! for a hazard whose incidence nobody can bound.
//!
//! So the storage moves instead. In a **test build** each thread gets its own
//! instance of the table, which is exactly the isolation the clear was reaching
//! for: `reset_copying_nursery_runtime_test_state()` on thread U empties U's
//! instance, which already contains only U's entries, and thread T's test is
//! structurally out of reach. libtest runs one thread per test, so "per thread"
//! and "per test" coincide.
//!
//! In a **non-test build** the macro expands to the plain `static` it replaced,
//! byte for byte. `test_clear_*` is `#[cfg(test)]` and never runs in a shipped
//! runtime, so the whole hazard — and the whole fix — is confined to tests.
//!
//! Call sites do not change: [`PerThread`] derefs to the table, so
//! `SYMBOL_REGISTRY.lock()` and `CLASS_PROTOTYPE_OBJECTS.read()` keep working
//! as written.
//!
//! # What holds the line
//!
//! * `scripts/global_sink_isolation.py` (runs in `lint`) derives the clear list
//!   from `reset_copying_nursery_runtime_test_state`'s own source, resolves the
//!   storage behind each helper, and FAILS on a bare `static` that is neither
//!   thread-local nor declared here. A new sink cannot be added quietly, and a
//!   new *reader* never has to remember anything.
//! * `gc::tests::global_sink_isolation` plants the #7671 shape — write on this
//!   thread, run the guards' clear on another, read back — for each converted
//!   table, and proves the harness still catches an unconverted one via a
//!   deliberately bare canary. A green run means the detector works, not that
//!   nothing was tried.

/// Per-thread instance of a process-global side table, for test builds.
///
/// Constructed only by [`per_test_global!`]. Derefs to `T`, so every call
/// site that used the `static` directly is unchanged.
///
/// The instance is leaked (`Box::leak`) rather than dropped at thread exit:
/// `Deref::deref` must hand out a reference that outlives the borrow of the
/// `static`, and a thread-exit drop would dangle it. The cost is bounded by
/// (threads that touched the table) x (empty table size); a libtest thread that
/// never touches a table never allocates one.
