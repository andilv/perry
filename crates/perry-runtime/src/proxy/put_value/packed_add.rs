//! The key-add half of the generated static-key store (`o.k = v` where `k` is
//! not yet an own property of `o`).
//!
//! # What the site holds
//!
//! A static-key store site owns one [`PackedSetSite`]: the existing-key word
//! (`packed_set.rs`) and two ADD words. The add words are a memo of a pure
//! function of ONE ShapeId, the PRE-shape `S`:
//!
//! > appending `k` to any receiver carrying `S` yields ShapeId `T`, with the
//! > value at slot `s` (inline, or in overflow storage).
//!
//! `S` names an immutable key list, live inline bound, prototype identity
//! ([[Prototype]] is a shape fact) and descriptor/integrity state, so the
//! successor is determined: [`packed_add_prime`] does not merely observe the
//! runtime's transition, it re-derives it from the two descriptors (`T`'s key
//! list is `S`'s plus `k` at index `s`, same prototype, same semantic
//! generation, same kind, no holes, and `T`'s live bound is exactly what the
//! append rule gives) and publishes nothing otherwise.
//!
//! The one input that is NOT a property of `S` is whether the prototype chain
//! intercepts the write (an inherited setter, an inherited non-writable data
//! property). That verdict is the inherited-access lane's
//! (`object::chain_store`): every prototype hop AND every class id of the
//! chain is MARKED before the verdict is computed, so any later change that
//! could flip it moves the one global word `proto_validity`. The guard word
//! records it, read after the marking and before the predicate, and the
//! emitted hit re-proves the verdict with one load and one compare. Evaluating
//! or registering a class moves nothing unless a verdict walked that class. The prototype the verdict walked is the one
//! the receiver's SHAPE names, because the pre-shape compare is what admitted
//! the receiver.
//!
//! # What the emitted hit re-tests per object
//!
//! (`perry-codegen/src/expr/put_value_store_ic.rs`, `emit_key_add_hit`.)
//! The pre-shape compare proves GC kind, not forwarded, not frozen / sealed /
//! non-extensible, the key absent, no own descriptor, the prototype, the
//! object kind, and that the receiver is neither a marked prototype nor an
//! exotic read receiver (both marks move an object onto a private lineage,
//! and the prime never learns one; a prototype's structural change must go
//! through the stamp funnel, which moves the validity word). It cannot prove per-object facts, which the hit reads:
//!
//! * the receiver kind and the Array-subclass numeric proof, exactly as the
//!   existing-key hit (`_reserved` and `class_id`);
//! * `GC_FLAG_TENURED` clear: the stamp funnel
//!   (`shapes::stamp_object_shape_id_with_carrier_note`) owes an
//!   old-generation receiver a carrier note. `Old => TENURED` (every old-gen
//!   placement ORs the bit in; see `write_barrier.rs`) and objects are only
//!   ever born in the nursery or old space (`arena_alloc_gc`), so a clear bit
//!   proves the receiver young and the note unnecessary;
//! * no stable tombstones and no descriptor flag (both conservative: the
//!   shape already covers them);
//! * the layout state: a `GC_LAYOUT_SIDE_MASK` or typed-layout receiver's
//!   layout record describes the PRE-shape, so the hit first calls
//!   [`js_gc_key_add_layout_unknown`] (the transition lane's
//!   `mark_object_dynamic_shape_unknown`), exactly as the runtime does.
//!
//! Everything else takes the miss, which serves the memo in the runtime
//! ([`packed_add_try`], through the audited stamp funnel and overflow store)
//! before falling back to the full `[[Set]]`.
//!
//! # GC: the memo's ShapeIds stay resolvable
//!
//! An intermediate constructor shape is carried by no object once
//! construction finishes, so a full trace would retire it. A site that stamps
//! `T` must therefore own `T` (and `S`): both are noted as cache carriers when
//! published and re-noted after every full trace from the registry of primed
//! sites ([`note_packed_add_carriers`], called by
//! `shape_carriers::recompute_after_full_trace`). A cache-carried descriptor's
//! keys array is rooted and rewritten by the shape table's scan. The words
//! hold only numbers, never a heap address.
//!
//! # Agents
//!
//! Sites are process-global. Only the primary agent primes (and registers) a
//! site; ShapeIds are process-unique, so a worker's receivers never match a
//! primary-agent pre-shape and a worker only ever takes the miss.
