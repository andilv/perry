//! Async bridge: settles Perry Promises from native work, on the thread that
//! owns the JS heap.
//!
//! Native work — a turnloop pool job or a plain OS thread — never builds a
//! JSValue. It queues either finished bits (`queue_promise_resolution`) or a
//! converter (`queue_deferred_resolution`), and `js_stdlib_process_pending`
//! settles the promise on the main thread.
//!
//! IMPORTANT: perry-runtime uses thread-local arenas for memory allocation.
//! This means JSValue objects created on worker threads will be allocated
//! from a different arena than the main thread, causing memory corruption.
//!
//! To avoid this, async operations should:
//! 1. NOT create JSValue objects (arrays, strings, objects) off the main thread
//! 2. Store raw Rust data and use deferred conversion callbacks
//! 3. The conversion callbacks run on the main thread during js_stdlib_process_pending
//!
//! # One queue, many agents (#11433)
//!
//! "The main thread" above means *the agent that owns the promise*. Since
//! turnloop P9 a `node:worker_threads` Worker (and a `perry/thread` worker) is
//! an agent with its own heap, its own loop, and its own call to
//! `js_stdlib_process_pending` from its await loop. The two queues below are
//! process-global, so every entry carries the [`AgentId`] it belongs to and a
//! pump settles only its own agent's entries, leaving the rest for their
//! owner — the model `perry_runtime::agent` already applies to timers and
//! thread results. Before this, whichever agent pumped first took everything:
//! the primary agent settled a Worker's `fetch` promise (running the Worker's
//! continuation on the main thread, against the main heap) and the Worker
//! settled the primary agent's, which is how
//! `test_gap_turnloop_p9_worker_agent_net` printed `immediate 000undefined`,
//! lost messages, and threw `Invalid response handle` about half the time.
//!
//! The owner is the agent current at *enqueue* time. A producer that queues
//! from a thread with no agent of its own — a pool job, a fallback OS thread —
//! would read as the primary agent there, so the spawn helpers capture the
//! submitting agent and re-assert it around the job with
//! [`ResolutionOwnerScope`].
//!
//! # No tokio
//!
//! This is the only async bridge perry-stdlib has. Turnloop P8 lane L split
//! the tokio current-thread runtime out of this module into a sibling
//! `tokio_bridge` behind an `async-runtime` feature; the final tokio lane
//! deleted both, together with the `perry_ffi_spawn_async` /
//! `_with_reactor` C ABI that was their last user. Every program links no
//! tokio: CPU work goes to turnloop's pool (`pool_for_promise_deferred`),
//! I/O to the owning agent's turnloop loop.
