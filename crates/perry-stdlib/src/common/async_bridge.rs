//! Async bridge: settles Perry Promises from native work, on the thread that
//! owns the JS heap.
//!
//! Native work — a turnloop pool job, a plain OS thread, or, in a build with
//! the `async-runtime` feature, a tokio task — never builds a JSValue. It
//! queues either finished bits (`queue_promise_resolution`) or a converter
//! (`queue_deferred_resolution`), and `js_stdlib_process_pending` settles the
//! promise on the main thread.
//!
//! IMPORTANT: perry-runtime uses thread-local arenas for memory allocation.
//! This means JSValue objects created on worker threads will be allocated
//! from a different arena than the main thread, causing memory corruption.
//!
//! To avoid this, async operations should:
//! 1. NOT create JSValue objects (arrays, strings, objects) off the main thread
//! 2. Store raw Rust data and use deferred conversion callbacks
//! 3. The conversion callbacks run on the main thread during js_stdlib_process_pending
//!
//! # No tokio here (turnloop P8 lane L)
//!
//! This module is compiled under `async-bridge` and contains no tokio. The
//! tokio current-thread runtime and everything that drives it live in
//! `super::tokio_bridge`, which only `async-runtime` compiles — the features
//! whose code hands it tokio futures (bundled net/tls/ws sockets, reqwest
//! fetch, the container engine) and the `perry_ffi_spawn_async` /
//! `_with_reactor` C ABI that perry-ext-net / perry-ext-http still use. A
//! program that needs none of those (crypto, bcrypt, argon2, zlib, readline,
//! nodemailer, worker_threads, a UI app) links no tokio at all. The tokio
//! half's public names are re-exported below so no caller's path changed.

/// JS-side roots reach only `N`. The tokio future holds `promise_ptr`
/// as `usize`, invisible to the GC. So `js_promise_new()` in a native

/// when the worker finally calls `js_promise_resolve(P, ...)` it
/// dereferences freed (and possibly OS-reclaimed) memory → SIGBUS.
