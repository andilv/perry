//! #11319: an exiting thread releases its entries in perry-runtime's
//! process-global closure side tables.
//!
//! Those tables outlive the thread that inserted an entry, while the young log
//! naming the entry is thread-local and the owner's arena block goes back to
//! the allocator at thread exit. A left-behind entry therefore read, once
//! another thread's arena reused the address, as that thread's young owner
//! its log never noted — the `gc/young_log.rs` rule-2 panic that aborted this
//! suite — and it handed its props to any closure later allocated there.
//!
//! Only reachable with perry-runtime built as an ordinary dependency: its own
//! unit tests keep freed blocks mapped and make these tables per-thread.
