//! turnloop P6: Perry's **outbound** HTTP/1.1 on turnloop handles.
//!
//! P1 put Perry's sockets on turnloop and P5 put the HTTP/1.1 *server* codec and
//! TLS there. This is the client half: `fetch`, `axios` and anything else that
//! issues an outbound request is a state machine driven by `NET_*` completions
//! on the agent's own `turnloop::Loop` rather than a `reqwest` future driven by
//! a tokio tick. Since lane G of the tokio removal it is the ONLY transport:
//! `perry-stdlib` no longer depends on `reqwest` at all.

//!
//! # What is refused
//!
//! A thread without a loop of its own is not refused: since turnloop P10
//! `submit` posts to the thread that owns the agent's loop (`posted`). What is
//! left is a genuine absence of a loop for the whole agent — a host where
//! `Loop::new` failed — plus three request-shaped refusals the owner would make
//! identically (`Declined`). Each used to fall back to a `reqwest` future; each
//! now rejects the caller's promise with Node's error for the same input
//! (`fetch::transport_error::Rejection`).
//!
//! Every policy decision — redirects, the pool, the per-phase deadlines, the
//! proxy environment, `Content-Encoding` — comes from `turnloop_http::client`
//! and `turnloop_http::compression` rather than being written here. This module
//! owns the *transport*: sockets, completions, ids and TLS.
//!
//! # Why not `turnloop_http::asynchronous::client`
//!
//! The same reason P5 gave for the server: it needs a `turnloop_io::
//! ExecutorHandle`, `LocalExecutor::with_config` constructs its **own** driver,
//! and even sharing one, `Shared::dispatch` returns early for a token without
//! its tag bit — P1's net tokens, P2's process tokens, P3's timer token and P4's
//! pool tokens would all be silently dropped (turnloop#45). Perry owns one
//! `turnloop::Loop` per agent, so the codecs are driven sans-I/O over P1's
//! completion layer.
//!
//! # Ids
//!
//! Every turnloop handle on a thread lives in ONE `HashMap<i64, Entry>` in
//! `turnloop_net`, regardless of subsystem — and perry-ffi's handle band
//! (`[1, 0x40000)`, which is what `perry-ext-net` names its sockets from) and
//! perry-stdlib's `common` handle band are two *different* registries over the
//! *same* numeric range. Ids allocated here therefore come from a private band
//! starting at `ID_BASE = 1 << 40`, far above both, so a client socket can never
//! be confused with a `net.Socket`. `ids_are_disjoint_from_the_binding_bands`
//! tests that rather than leaving it to the comment.
//!
//! # GC
//!
//! **No JS value and no heap pointer reaches the driver**, exactly as in P1 and
//! P5. A request carries owned `String`/`Vec<u8>` and the `usize` address of a
//! promise created by `js_promise_new_cross_thread`, which pins it (#9552);
//! reads land in turnloop's pooled
//! buffers and are copied out inside the dispatch call. So this module registers
//! no GC root scanner, and `scripts/gc_runtime_root_holders.py` needs no entry
//! for it.
