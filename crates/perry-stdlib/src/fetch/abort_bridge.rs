//! Bridges a JS `AbortSignal` to an in-flight `fetch` so the request rejects
//! when the signal aborts — either `controller.abort()` or an
//! `AbortSignal.timeout(ms)` deadline elapsing.
//!
//! The signal reaches the native fetch via the runtime's pending-signal stash
//! (`js_fetch_set_pending_signal` / `js_fetch_take_pending_signal`), alongside
//! the equivalent `RequestInit.redirect` bridge, which keeps the 4-arg
//! `js_fetch_with_options` ABI unchanged. At the start of
//! `js_fetch_with_options` (main thread) the signal's object address becomes
//! the request's cancellation key in the turnloop client engine.
//!
//! The signal's abort reaches us through the runtime: `fire_abort_listeners`
//! (run by `controller.abort()` and the `AbortSignal.timeout` deadline) calls
//! `js_fetch_notify_signal_aborted`, which cancels every engine request bound
//! to that key. There is deliberately no per-fetch JS `abort` listener, so
//! reused signals never accumulate stale listener closures.
//!
//! Before the reqwest fallback was removed this module also kept a registry of
//! `tokio::sync::Notify`s that a reqwest future `select!`ed against. Every
//! fetch now goes through the engine, which owns cancellation itself, so the
//! registry had no reader left and went with it. Refs the AbortSignal runtime
//! in `perry_runtime::url::abort`.
