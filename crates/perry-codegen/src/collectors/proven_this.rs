//! Representation-selection Phase 5a (RFC `docs/representation-selection-rfc.md`
//! §4 Object row, §5.4, §5.6): the **proven `this`** of a class method.
//!
//! ## The proof already exists — this phase stops discarding it
//!
//! Two call sites already prove a receiver's exact shape and then call the
//! guard-ridden PUBLIC method body, where every `this.field` re-enters the
//! per-access guarded diamond (`expr/class_field_inline_guard.rs`) whose cost
//! is unhoistable by construction (volatile gate + the fallback arm's opaque
//! call block LICM):
//!
//! 1. `lower_call/method_override.rs` — the `method_direct.fast` arm, entered
//!    only after `js_typed_feedback_method_direct_call_guard` /
//!    `js_method_direct_shape_guard` matched **class_id AND the keys token**.
//! 2. `lower_call/property_get/dynamic_dispatch.rs` — the Phase 3b guard-free
//!    `Ptr<Shape>` receiver arm, whose receiver is a shape-proven local.
//!
//! Phase 5a emits an `internal` `{public}$pshape` clone of the method whose
//! `this` carries the [`PtrShapeLocal`] proof, and routes those two sites to
//! it. Net new proof work: zero. Net new GC work: zero — the clone keeps the
//! identical `(double this, double args…)` ABI and the identical shadow-bound
//! tagged-at-rest receiver slot (`codegen/method.rs`), because `GC_TYPE_OBJECT`
//! is MOVABLE and the `TaPtr` no-shadow shortcut does not transfer. Net new
//! layout work: zero — field indexes come from `class_field_global_index`,
//! which is chain-global (parent fields first).
//!
//! ## Why the receiver is exactly this class
//!
//! `this` inside `C.prototype.m` can in general be an instance of any SUBCLASS
//! of `C`, which would invalidate a proof rooted at `C`'s chain. Phase 5a
//! sidesteps this entirely at the ROUTING sites rather than here: both of them
//! only route when the receiver's proven exact class **declares** the method
//! (`ctx.methods` holds own-declarations only — `method_registry.rs` never
//! inserts inherited entries), so the class the clone was compiled for is the
//! receiver's exact dynamic class. Inherited dispatch (`d.m()` resolving to
//! `Base::m`) keeps today's lowering.
//!
//! ## `numeric_fields` is deliberately NOT claimed
//!
//! A Phase 3b local claims `JsNumber`/`F64` per field under an EXHAUSTIVE
//! reachable-store proof, which containment makes possible: no alias to the
//! object exists, so the analysis sees every store. A proven `this` is owned by
//! the CALLER and is aliased by construction — `counter.value = "s"` elsewhere
//! is a reachable store this analysis cannot enumerate, and it downgrades the
//! slot's raw-f64 layout at runtime. A guard-free read cannot consult that
//! layout, so claiming `JsNumber` would be unsound. Phase 5a therefore emits
//! bare `load double` with generic `JsValue` semantics — still fully
//! guard-free, and bit-identical (a NaN-boxed number IS its own double bits).
//! Recovering the numeric claim needs a whole-program no-external-store proof;
//! that is deferred.
//!
//! ## `delete` is aliased across modules by construction (#7143) — closed, not a bug
//!
//! [`method_proven_this`] below consults `ModuleDispatchFacts::has_shape_barrier_sites`,
//! which `collect_module_dispatch_facts`
//! (`collectors/scalar_method_dispatch.rs`) computes **per module**. A
//! `delete` / `Reflect.deleteProperty` in a module
//! that never declares `class_name` sets no flag this admission check can
//! see. Unlike a Phase 3b `Ptr<Shape>` LOCAL — whose containment (rule 2,
//! `ptr_shape.rs`) proves no alias to the object can exist ANYWHERE, in this
//! module or any other — a proven `this` is the caller's object and is
//! aliased by construction: it can be handed to another module, deleted
//! from there, and handed back.
//!
//! This is sound anyway. Every routing site that can call a `$pshape` clone
//! re-derives the guarantee itself, at the point it actually matters, rather
//! than trusting this admission-time fact to have seen the whole program:
//!
//! * `method_direct.fast` (`lower_call/method_override.rs`) sits behind
//!   `js_method_direct_shape_guard` / `js_typed_feedback_method_direct_call_guard`,
//!   whose contract includes `receiver.keys_array == expected_keys` — a raw
//!   POINTER compare (`typed_feedback/guards.rs`). The only code path
//!   `js_object_delete_field` has for a `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` instance with a
//!   keys array clones a FRESH keys array and repoints `keys_array` at it
//!   (`perry-runtime/src/object/delete_rest.rs`; `Reflect.deleteProperty`
//!   shares the same function) — for ANY key, declared or not, from ANY
//!   module. The pointer compare can therefore never pass on a post-delete
//!   instance, regardless of what this admission check saw.
//! * The Phase 3b guard-free `Ptr<Shape>` receiver arm needs no runtime
//!   check at all, because rule 2's containment already rules out the alias
//!   existing in the first place: creating one — `let other = o`, passing
//!   `o` to ANY function, same module or not — is itself a disqualifying
//!   use the containment walk sees directly. There is no alias left for a
//!   `delete` anywhere to reach the object through.
//! * #7142's class-id dispatch-tower case
//!   (`lower_call/property_get/dynamic_dispatch.rs::emit_tower_pshape_call`)
//!   carries its own explicit re-check
//!   (`class_field_inline_guard::emit_proven_shape_recheck`) for exactly
//!   this reason — that function's doc comment cites this issue by number: a
//!   static, module-scoped proof would have been "exactly the wrong
//!   instrument" for a receiver that can be aliased across modules.
//!
//! So `has_shape_barrier_sites()` here is a **cost-control heuristic** —
//! whether emitting a clone is even worth it, given the module's own code
//! may never take a fast path to it — never the mechanism that makes routing
//! to one safe. A future 4th routing site must independently re-derive one
//! of the two guarantees above (a dominating keys-token recheck, or genuine
//! containment); it must NOT rely on this fact having seen a `delete` that,
//! by construction, may have happened in a module this one never looked at.
//!
//! Confirmed empirically, not just by proof-reading:
//! `test-files/test_issue_7143_delete_barrier_cross_module.ts` (+
//! `test-files/fixtures/issue_7143_pkg/shared.ts`) is exactly this shape — a
//! `delete` in the importing module, then a call back into the declaring
//! module on the mutated instance — and the emitted `--trace llvm` IR shows
//! the `$pshape` call dominated by `js_typed_feedback_method_direct_call_guard`
//! as described above; the compiled binary's output matches
//! `node --experimental-strip-types` exactly. The
//! `guarded_pshape_call_site_is_preceded_by_a_keys_token_guard` test in
//! `proven_this_routing_tests.rs` pins the same invariant at the IR level so
//! a future change to the routing sites can't silently drop it.
//!
//! Gated by `PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_THIS` (default on; `0`/`off`/`false` disables —
//! keyed into the object cache). Also honours `PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_LOCALS`, since
//! Phase 5a is an extension of the same `Ptr<Shape>` proof.
