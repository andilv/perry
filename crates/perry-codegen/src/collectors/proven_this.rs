//! Representation-selection Phase 5a (RFC `docs/representation-selection-rfc.md`
//! §4 Object row, §5.4, §5.6): the **proven `this`** of a class method.
//!
//! ## The proof already exists — this phase stops discarding it
//!
//! Two call sites already prove a receiver's exact shape and then call the
//! guard-ridden PUBLIC method body, where every `this.field` re-enters the
//! per-access guarded diamond (`expr/class_field_inline_guard.rs`) whose cost
//! is unhoistable by construction (volatile gate + the fallback arm's opaque
//! call block LICM):
//!
//! 1. `lower_call/method_override.rs` — the `method_direct.fast` arm, entered
//!    only after `js_typed_feedback_method_direct_call_guard` /
//!    `js_method_direct_shape_guard` matched **class_id AND the keys token**.
//! 2. `lower_call/property_get/dynamic_dispatch.rs` — the Phase 3b guard-free
//!    `Ptr<Shape>` receiver arm, whose receiver is a shape-proven local.
//!
//! Phase 5a emits an `internal` `{public}__pshape` clone of the method whose
//! `this` carries the [`PtrShapeLocal`] proof, and routes those two sites to
//! it. Net new proof work: zero. Net new GC work: zero — the clone keeps the
//! identical `(double this, double args…)` ABI and the identical shadow-bound
//! tagged-at-rest receiver slot (`codegen/method.rs`), because `GC_TYPE_OBJECT`
//! is MOVABLE and the `TaPtr` no-shadow shortcut does not transfer. Net new
//! layout work: zero — field indexes come from `class_field_global_index`,
//! which is chain-global (parent fields first).
//!
//! ## Why the receiver is exactly this class
//!
//! `this` inside `C.prototype.m` can in general be an instance of any SUBCLASS
//! of `C`, which would invalidate a proof rooted at `C`'s chain. Phase 5a
//! sidesteps this entirely at the ROUTING sites rather than here: both of them
//! only route when the receiver's proven exact class **declares** the method
//! (`ctx.methods` holds own-declarations only — `method_registry.rs` never
//! inserts inherited entries), so the class the clone was compiled for is the
//! receiver's exact dynamic class. Inherited dispatch (`d.m()` resolving to
//! `Base::m`) keeps today's lowering.
//!
//! ## `numeric_fields` is deliberately NOT claimed
//!
//! A Phase 3b local claims `JsNumber`/`F64` per field under an EXHAUSTIVE
//! reachable-store proof, which containment makes possible: no alias to the
//! object exists, so the analysis sees every store. A proven `this` is owned by
//! the CALLER and is aliased by construction — `counter.value = "s"` elsewhere
//! is a reachable store this analysis cannot enumerate, and it downgrades the
//! slot's raw-f64 layout at runtime. A guard-free read cannot consult that
//! layout, so claiming `JsNumber` would be unsound. Phase 5a therefore emits
//! bare `load double` with generic `JsValue` semantics — still fully
//! guard-free, and bit-identical (a NaN-boxed number IS its own double bits).
//! Recovering the numeric claim needs a whole-program no-external-store proof;
//! that is deferred.
//!
//! Gated by `PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_THIS` (default on; `0`/`off`/`false` disables —
//! keyed into the object cache). Also honours `PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_LOCALS`, since
//! Phase 5a is an extension of the same `Ptr<Shape>` proof.
