//! Repsel profitability model (#7128): refuse a canonical-i32 promotion whose
//! every hot consumer wants a double.
//!
//! ## The measurement this exists for
//!
//! #7128 measured the #7106/#7034 coverage campaign on a quiet Raspberry Pi 5
//! with `perf stat`, at a 0.02% noise floor. canonical-i32 went from 2/18 to
//! 17/18 real workloads and bought: one −1.05% (`11_prime_sieve`), fifteen
//! exact zeros, and **one +14.87% regression** (`15_mandelbrot`), bisected by
//! binary hash to #7121.
//!
//! The mechanism is visible in the emitted AArch64, not inferred. In
//! `15_mandelbrot` the innermost loop is
//!
//! ```text
//! while (x * x + y * y <= 4.0 && iter < MAX_ITER) { …; iter = iter + 1; }
//! …
//! totalIter = totalIter + iter;
//! ```
//!
//! With `iter` a double the whole loop is **one basic block of 12
//! instructions**: LLVM fuses the two exit tests into `fcmp` + `fccmp` and
//! branches once. With `iter` in a canonical i32 slot the integer test cannot
//! fuse with the FP test, the loop splits into **two blocks of 14 instructions
//! total** (an extra compare-and-branch plus a register copy for the induction
//! phi), and the accumulator join needs a `ucvtf` it did not need before. Two
//! instructions × 8,011,148 innermost iterations ≈ 16.0M, against a measured
//! +15.63M. That is the whole regression.
//!
//! ## Why this is a profitability rule and not a soundness rule
//!
//! Nothing about the promotion is *wrong*. #7122's monotone loop-induction
//! interval proves `iter ∈ [0, 100]`, which is true. The defect is that the
//! promotion was chosen on **provability** rather than on **benefit**: the
//! Let-site gate is a conjunction of "may we?" terms with no "should we?" term
//! anywhere in it, so any widening of the proof automatically widens the
//! emission.
//!
//! The benefit argument is short. For values inside i32 range, `double` is a
//! *lossless and equal-cost* representation of `+`, `-` and comparison — one
//! instruction either way on every target Perry ships. The i32 representation
//! only *buys* something where the consumer cannot take a double at all
//! without a conversion:
//!
//! * an array / typed-array **index** (`a[v]`),
//! * a **bitwise** operand (`&`, `|`, `^`, `<<`, `>>`, `>>>`, `~`),
//! * `Math.imul`.
//!
//! Everywhere else it is at best neutral — and it becomes a *cost* the moment
//! a consumer needs the double back, because that consumer now emits a
//! `sitofp`/`uitofp` the boxed representation never needed.
//!
//! So the rule is: **a local that is written after its declaration, has no
//! i32-consuming read anywhere, and has at least one double-consuming read
//! inside a loop, does not select canonical i32.**
//!
//! Each of the three conjuncts earns its place:
//!
//! * *written after declaration* — a single-assignment local is loop-invariant
//!   at every read, so any conversion is hoisted out of the loop by LICM and
//!   costs O(1), not O(iterations). `const WIDTH = 800` in `15_mandelbrot` is
//!   read as a double twice per inner iteration and still costs nothing,
//!   because the value is a constant. Judging it would be pure census churn.
//! * *no i32-consuming read* — one array index is enough to make the
//!   representation pay for itself; `11_prime_sieve`'s counters are all
//!   index-used, which is why its −1.05% survives this rule untouched.
//! * *a double-consuming read inside a loop* — a conversion outside every loop
//!   runs once. `return iter` after the loop is not a reason to refuse.
//!
//! ## Deliberate under-approximation
//!
//! This analysis can only ever **remove** selections, so every uncertainty is
//! resolved toward "not a cost": an expression form this module does not model
//! contributes `Neutral`, never `Double`. Two consequences worth naming:
//!
//! * **Comparison is always neutral**, on both sides, even against a
//!   non-integer operand. `for (let i = 0; i < n; i++)` with a `number`
//!   parameter `n` is the single most common loop in JavaScript; classifying
//!   its guard as a double consumer would refuse nearly every counter in the
//!   corpus to buy nothing measurable.
//! * **A write of a local into its own slot never costs** (`iter = iter + 1`),
//!   because the value never leaves the representation it arrived in — but it
//!   still *counts as a benefit* when it lands in an i32-consuming position.
//!   `seed = (Math.imul(seed, K) + C) & 0x7fffffff` is a local whose only read
//!   is inside its own assignment and whose whole reason to want an i32 slot
//!   is that read.
//!
//!   The exemption is about the *representation flow*, not the syntactic shape
//!   `t = … t …`: it is cleared on the way through any operation that forces a
//!   materialization (a `/` or `**` operand, a call or `new` argument), so
//!   `x = x / 2` and `x = f(x)` are still costs. Those genuinely convert out
//!   and back on every iteration, which is the failure mode this module
//!   exists to refuse — re-entering through the exemption instead of through
//!   the original path.
//!
//! A missed refusal is today's behaviour. A spurious refusal is a lost
//! promotion, so the model is built to err in the first direction.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! Consumed only by the canonical-i32 gate (`canonical_i32_value_eligible` in
//! `stmt/let_stmt.rs`), never by the parallel-shadow `needs_i32_slot` gate — so
//! `PERRY_CANONICAL_I32_LOCALS=0` still reproduces the pre-phase model
//! bit-for-bit, the same containment `int_valued_ta_locals` and
//! `loop_bounded_i32_locals` use. canonical `Str` and `Ptr<*>` are untouched;
//! they have the same disease (#7128 findings C and D) and are the next
//! consumers this model is shaped for, but widening it to them is a separate
//! measurement.
