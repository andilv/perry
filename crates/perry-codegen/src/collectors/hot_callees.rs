//! Whole-module pre-pass that finds user functions eligible for the
//! inline-hot-small heuristic: **small** functions that are called from a
//! **loop** and have **few total call sites**.
//!
//! Why all three conditions (see `codegen/function.rs` for the size gate, and
//! `linker.rs` for the raised `-inlinehint-threshold`):
//!
//! * **In a loop** (approx. "hot", since AOT has no profile) — a function only
//!   ever called from straight-line / cold code is never hinted, so cold
//!   utility functions can't bloat the binary.
//! * **Few call sites** — this is the anti-bloat backstop. `inlinehint` +
//!   the raised threshold lifts LLVM's inline ceiling for the callee at *every*
//!   one of its call sites (LLVM can't tell hot from cold per-site through a
//!   function attribute). A small function called from 1 hot loop **and** 300
//!   cold sites would therefore be duplicated 300×. Capping total call sites
//!   bounds the duplication: a hinted function is inlined at most
//!   `max_call_sites` times, so the added code is bounded regardless of the
//!   raised threshold. A bit-mixer kernel like `mix` has 1 HIR call site, so it
//!   qualifies; a shared helper called from dozens of sites does not.
//!
//! Direction of error: **under-inclusion is safe** (a missed call site just
//! forgoes an inlining opportunity or, via undercount, leaves a function
//! eligible when it has slightly more sites than counted — still bounded). We
//! never propagate the in-loop flag into a nested closure body (the closure
//! runs at its own, unknown frequency), so we can't wrongly mark a cold callee
//! hot. The walker covers the common expression containers and uses a
//! non-recursing catch-all for the long tail of runtime-intrinsic variants.

///
/// ## Why this is not [`collect_hot_loop_callees`]
///
/// It is the same "is this code hot" question **without the
/// `max_call_sites` cap**, because the cap answers a question the allocator
/// does not ask. `inlinehint` duplicates the whole callee body at every one of
/// its call sites, so its cost scales with call-site count and the cap is the
/// only thing bounding it. The inline bump allocator emits ~268 bytes **per
/// `new` site in the function itself**, once, whatever the call-site count —
/// so capping on call sites prices a cost that does not exist and, worse,
/// excludes precisely the functions that earn it.
///
/// `gc-handoff/apps/interp.ts`'s `evalNode` is the shape: it is *the* hot
/// function of the program (~20M invocations), it allocates a `Value` per
/// invocation, and it has 11 direct call sites — 10 of them its own recursion —
/// so the ≤4 cap excluded it and all eight of its object literals took the
/// outlined `js_object_alloc_class_inline_keys` call. Measured on the whole
/// 19-program corpus with `PERRY_INLINE_NEW=1` (which forces the inline form
/// everywhere): `interp` −16.2%, `iso_miss` −10.4%, `pipeline` −8.4%, and the
/// other 16 within a ±1.6% noise floor established by the 15 binaries that
/// come out byte-identical.
///
/// ## The three admission rules
///
/// 1. **≥1 direct call site inside a loop** — the existing proxy for "runs many
///    times", now uncapped.
/// 2. **Directly self-recursive** — a function that calls itself IS a loop, and
///    the existing lexical test cannot see it. `parseExpr`/`evalNode` are both;
///    a recursive descent whose entry call happens to sit in straight-line code
///    would otherwise pay the outlined allocator at every level of the
///    recursion.
/// 3. **Bounded closure module with an indirect loop call** — an indirect call
///    through a local/array value does not expose the target FuncId, as in
///    `pipeline`'s `stage = stages[s]; stage(rec)`. If the module contains such
///    a call, admit its allocation-bearing closures only when they contain at
///    most [`INDIRECT_CLOSURE_ALLOC_SITE_BUDGET`] `new` sites in total. The
///    all-or-none cap avoids traversal-order-dependent code size and prices the
///    actual emitted cost rather than closure count.
///
/// Direction of error is unchanged from the sibling: under-inclusion forgoes
/// speed, never correctness — the outlined call performs the identical bump
/// alloc + header init and returns the identical user pointer.
