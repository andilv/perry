//! Representation-selection Phase 3b, **#7034 §4: return-shape facts**.
//!
//! ## What this proves, and why it is the cheapest of the three escapes
//!
//! `#7034` measured `Ptr<Shape>` promotion on `benchmarks/app-patterns/
//! kernels/batch.ts` — the object/property-heavy workload the representation
//! exists for — and found **zero** promoted locals. Every real record escapes
//! its producing scope, and `collectors/ptr_shape.rs` rule 2 listed `return`,
//! `call argument` and `array/object element` as outright disqualifiers, so
//! the proof died at the first escape.
//!
//! Returns are the escape that needs no cross-function agreement, no ABI
//! change, and no clone-and-route machinery at all (contrast `proven_this.rs`,
//! whose `this` proof emits an internal per-method clone and routes call sites
//! to it). Two independent halves:
//!
//! 1. **Producer side** (`ptr_shape.rs`, rule 2's return exemption). A local
//!    whose every other use is contained is promoted even though it is
//!    returned, because a `return` is a terminator: the caller cannot observe
//!    — let alone reshape — the object until after every access this pass
//!    licenses has already run.
//! 2. **Caller side** (this file). If a module function's every return path
//!    hands back a *freshly allocated, unaliased* object of one class, a call
//!    to it is rule-1 provenance of exactly `new C(...)` strength, so
//!    `const r = producer(...)` becomes an ordinary `Ptr<Shape>` candidate
//!    and every `r.field` in the caller lowers guard-free.
//!
//! ## The freshness obligation, and how it is discharged
//!
//! Rule 1's `new C(...)` seed carries two facts: the dynamic class is exactly
//! `C`, and — because the allocation is *right there* — no other reference to
//! the object exists yet. A call site sees neither for free: `function get() {
//! return CACHE; }` also "returns a `C`", but its result is aliased by the
//! module, so a caller-side shape proof over it would be unsound the moment
//! anything else reshapes `CACHE`.
//!
//! So a return-shape fact is only issued when **every** return of the producer
//! is one of:
//!
//! * `return new C(...)` — fresh by construction. (Object literals lower to
//!   `Expr::New { class_name: "__AnonShape_…" }`, so `return { k: v }` is this
//!   case too.) The constructor's `this`-flow safety is re-proven by the
//!   *caller's* own rule 3 walk over `C`, which runs on the seeded candidate
//!   exactly as it does for a literal `new`.
//! * `return <local>` where that local is itself a **fully proven Phase 3b
//!   local of the producer's body**. That is the whole containment proof —
//!   single `Let` with a `new C(...)` init, every use a declared-chain field
//!   access or a `this`-flow-vetted method call, no alias, no capture, no
//!   other escape — which is precisely "no reference to this object exists
//!   anywhere but the returned one". It is discharged by re-running
//!   `collect_shape_proven_ptr_locals` over the producer's body rather than
//!   by a second, weaker approximation of it.
//!
//! Anything else — `return CACHE`, `return this.field`, `return mk()`,
//! `return cond ? a : b` — yields no fact.
//!
//! ## Why the producer must not fall off its end
//!
//! `function f(x) { if (x) return new C(); }` returns `undefined` on the other
//! path. A caller that treated the result as a proven `C` would emit a bare
//! fixed-offset load against a NaN-boxed `undefined`. The fact therefore also
//! requires that control cannot reach the end of the body: the last statement
//! must itself be a value-returning `return`, or a `throw`.
//!
//! ## GC contract
//!
//! **Nothing here introduces a new site that holds an object pointer.** The
//! caller-side binding is an ordinary NaN-boxed local slot — the same storage
//! it had before this pass existed — shadow-bound by
//! `collect_pointer_typed_locals` / `js_shadow_slot_bind` like any other
//! object local, and the returned register is dead the moment the `Let` stores
//! it. Every access re-derives the raw pointer from that slot inside one
//! region (`ptr_shape.rs`'s tagged-at-rest contract), so an evacuating
//! scavenge that moves the object rewrites the bound slot and the next access
//! observes the new address. `TaPtr`'s callee-side no-bind shortcut is NOT
//! copied here — it is sound only for non-movable typed-array storage, and
//! `GC_TYPE_OBJECT` is movable (#6990, #7019).
//!
//! ## Numeric fields are deliberately not claimed
//!
//! See the `'cand` loop in `ptr_shape.rs`: the producer's own stores are not
//! in the caller's region, so no exhaustive-reachable-store proof is
//! available. Same stand-down, same reason, as `proven_this.rs`.
//!
//! Gated by `PERRY_PTR_SHAPE_LOCALS` along with the rest of Phase 3b — no new
//! env knob, so there is no new unexercised off-state.
