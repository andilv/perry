//! `--opt-report` (#6952) support for the `Ptr<Shape>` collector.
//!
//! `collectors/ptr_shape.rs` already knows exactly which rule denied each
//! candidate — it just `continue`s. This module supplies the vocabulary and
//! the two auxiliary walks (binding names, loop depths, unbound allocation
//! sites) that let those `continue` sites record `(value, reason)` instead of
//! dropping the information on the floor.
//!
//! **Everything here runs only when [`crate::opt_report::enabled`] is true.**
//! The collector's returned facts are untouched either way: recording happens
//! *next to* the `continue`, never instead of it.
//!
//! ## On the actionability tiers
//!
//! The tier is a judgment about who can act, and it is stated here rather
//! than inferred at render time so it is reviewable in one place:
//!
//! - **`Fixable`** — the source could reasonably be written another way
//!   (stop reassigning, don't capture in a closure, don't add ad-hoc
//!   properties). The RFC's own examples.
//! - **`CompilerLimitation`** — the source is idiomatic TypeScript that
//!   Perry cannot yet prove through. `return`, call arguments and container
//!   elements are all in this bucket: #7034 §1/§4 established that the
//!   proof needs to survive an escape, and that work is not written yet.
//!   Telling a developer to stop returning records would be bad advice.
//! - **`InherentlyPolymorphic`** — genuinely dynamic; correctly boxed.
