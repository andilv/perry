//! Observational root-pressure report for the native-stack GC experiments.
//!
//! `perry compile --statepoint-report[=text|json]` records how many textual
//! calls see live roots, which ones can be omitted after the GC-effect audit,
//! and how much statepoint/stack-map metadata remains. Codegen never reads the
//! data back, so enabling the report cannot affect emitted IR.
//!
//! `PERRY_STATEPOINT_REPORT` is how the driver carries that flag across to the
//! rayon module workers — the driver sets it, nothing else should. It is not a
//! user-facing knob: accepting it from the environment made it a fifth GC env
//! knob with no CI arm, so that spelling was deleted under CLAUDE.md's GC knob
//! kill policy. `gc-native-roots.yml` exercises the report through the flag.
