//! `--opt-report` (#6952): surface which values Perry could *not* statically
//! type, why, and whether the developer can do anything about it.
//!
//! Perry's speed comes from proving static types and selecting unboxed
//! representations (`docs/representation-selection-rfc.md`). When a proof
//! fails the value stays NaN-boxed and the fast paths silently do not fire.
//! Before this module the only way to find out *which* values failed was to
//! read LLVM IR — which is how #7034 discovered, by accident, that
//! `Ptr<Shape>` promotion is **zero** on the object-heavy workload that
//! motivates it. This is the representation-selection analogue of LLVM's
//! `-Rpass-missed` optimization remarks.
//!
//! ## Shape
//!
//! - **Off by default.** [`enabled`] is a `OnceLock<bool>` over
//!   `PERRY_OPT_REPORT`; every recording entry point early-returns when it is
//!   false, *before* any string is formatted or allocated. The CLI promotes
//!   `--opt-report` to that env var on the main thread before rayon spawns
//!   the module workers, exactly like `--trace llvm` promotes `PERRY_SAVE_LL`.
//! - **Observational only.** Nothing in this module is read by codegen. The
//!   collectors record *in addition to*, never *instead of*, the `continue`
//!   that denied the candidate — the returned fact sets are bit-identical
//!   with the report on and off, which the CLI's byte-identical-object test
//!   asserts.
//! - **Attribution.** The representation collectors run on a bare `&[Stmt]`
//!   with no idea which function they belong to, so each codegen caller
//!   brackets its `collect_native_region_fact_graph` call with [`enter`],
//!   which pushes a thread-local (module, function, region-kind) scope. Sites
//!   that already hold an `FnCtx` (`expr/slot_rep.rs`) pass the names
//!   explicitly instead.
//! - **Sink.** A process-global `Mutex<Vec<Entry>>`. Module codegen is
//!   in-process on rayon workers, so no on-disk artifact hand-off is needed
//!   (unlike `--explain-lowering`, which predates this and re-reads JSON
//!   sidecars). The CLI drains it with [`take_entries`] after codegen.
//!
//! ## What it can and cannot see
//!
//! v1 reports **function + variable name**, because HIR carries names but not
//! source spans (`Stmt::Let` is `{id, name, ty, mutable, init}`). A
//! `LocalId -> Span` side-table populated during AST→HIR lowering would add
//! `file:line` and source snippets; that is tracked separately and is
//! strictly additive to this output.
