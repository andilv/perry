//! An own property beats a builtin, even on a receiver whose KIND is proven
//! (#10943).
//!
//! ECMA-262 resolves `recv.m(a)` as `Get(recv, "m")` then `Call`, so an own
//! `m` wins. perry lowers a method call to a DIRECT native call whenever it
//! can prove the receiver's kind — and an own property that shadows the method
//! leaves that proof entirely intact: `const m = new Map(); m.get = () => 1`
//! is still provably a Map. The result is a silent, PLAUSIBLE wrong value: a
//! zero-argument `Map.prototype.get` returns `undefined`, `Date.getTime` a
//! real timestamp, `Array.push` a length. Nothing throws.
//!
//! #10476 fixed this for UNPROVEN receivers, whose runtime kind already picks
//! between the builtin and the universal dispatcher. **A proof of KIND was
//! being read as a proof of NO OWN OVERRIDE.**
//!
//! # Why the guard is here and not in an arm
//!
//! `try_lower_property_get_method_call` is an ORDERED CHAIN, and the only arm
//! with a runtime diamond (`builtin_kind_guard`) is near its end — behind
//! `number_string`, the array arm and `map_set`. Every proven receiver is
//! claimed upstream and never reaches it, so extending that diamond emits a
//! guard nothing executes (measured: symbol present, call count 0). The guard
//! has to sit above the whole chain.
//!
//! # What is hoisted, and what is not
//!
//! Only the RECEIVER. The condition needs its value before the branch, so an
//! arm that re-lowered the receiver afterwards would evaluate an effectful one
//! (`make().get(k)`) twice. It is therefore materialised once above the branch
//! and re-read in both arms (`rooting::with_materialized_receiver`).
//!
//! ARGUMENTS are not hoisted. Each arm lowers its own, and a diamond runs
//! exactly one arm, so every argument is still evaluated exactly once at
//! runtime; the cost is two emitted copies, which is code size and not
//! semantics. That is what keeps this change from having to convert every arm
//! in the chain to operand form.
//!
//! The receiver EXPRESSION is passed down unchanged rather than rewritten to a
//! synthetic local, because every arm's proof is keyed on it — `is_array_expr`,
//! `receiver_class_name`, `is_date_receiver`, the `Ptr<Shape>` facts. A
//! synthetic local would erase those proofs and silently un-specialise every
//! one of these calls.
//!
//! # The guard only chooses a branch
//!
//! It never resolves the property and calls it: an own slot can hold a builtin
//! thunk that dispatches by name again, and an earlier attempt at this fix did
//! exactly that and overflowed the stack. The other side of the diamond is the
//! universal dispatcher, which already finds an own or inherited user method.
