/// The field name a constructor-prologue statement assigns from a plain

/// **Two HIR shapes mean the same thing here, and matching only one of them is
/// what #7512 was** (`new Node(v, w)` measured 63% slower than the equivalent
/// `{v, w}` literal, the reverse of the expected ordering):
///
/// - `Expr::PropertySet` is what the compiler SYNTHESIZES. Every anon-shape
///   object-literal constructor (`lower/context.rs::mint_anon_shape_class`)
///   and the destructuring lowering emit it directly.
/// - `Expr::PutValueSet` is what USER SOURCE lowers to. `lower_expr`'s
///   assignment arm (`perry-hir/src/lower/lower_expr/assignment.rs`) turns
///   *every* source-level `obj.prop = value` — `this.v = v` in a hand-written
///   constructor included — into the spec `PutValue` node. Nothing a user can
///   type produces `Expr::PropertySet`.
///
/// So #7469's elision, which only ever matched `PropertySet`, fired on the
/// synthesized literal ctor and was structurally unreachable for the declared
/// class it was documented as covering. The class paid two extra full
/// class-field-set IC diamonds per construction — a guard call plus a
/// by-name `js_class_field_set_fallback` each, since a fresh instance has no
/// typed-shape descriptor yet and the raw-f64 guard therefore cannot pass —
/// writing a compile-time-constant `undefined` that the next two statements
/// overwrite.
///
/// The proof obligation is identical for both shapes and is entirely about the
/// *operand* expressions, not the store opcode: `This` and `LocalGet(<plain
/// param>)` cannot throw, allocate, or observe `this`, so the assignment is
/// reached before any other effect of the constructor.
///
/// **What the elided write is NOT** (the obvious objection, and it is
/// measurably wrong — `test-files/test_class_field_init_proto_setter.ts`): it
/// is not an observable `[[Set]]`, so eliding it cannot change how many times
/// an accessor runs. A class field declaration is a `CreateDataProperty` — a
/// DEFINE — per `ClassFieldDefinitionRecord` evaluation, so it never consults
/// an inherited accessor, and it installs an OWN data property that the
/// prologue's assignment then writes directly rather than dispatching past.
/// A setter installed on the prototype *after* compilation (which the
/// `class.setters` check below cannot see, by construction) runs **zero**
/// times either way, matching Node exactly. The reading in which the field
/// init is a `[[Set]]` and the setter therefore fires twice is the legacy
/// `useDefineForClassFields: false` behaviour, which neither this compiler nor
/// Node implements. The `class.setters` refusal below exists for the separate
/// case of a setter the class DECLARES, where Perry's own class-field-set
/// lowering does dispatch to the synthesized `__set_<name>` method.
///
/// `PutValueSet` additionally requires a constant string key (a computed key
/// is an arbitrary expression that can run user code) and `receiver` to be
/// `This` as well, since codegen evaluates both.

/// `constructor(v, w) { this.v = v; this.w = w }` — opens with a run of plain
/// `this.f = <param>` statements. For those fields the `undefined` write is a
/// dead store: it is overwritten before any code that could read `this.f`
/// runs. On `churn.ts` that dead store was 2 of the 4 guarded field-store
/// sequences per object literal — a set-guard FFI call, a string addref, and a
/// layout note per field, 20M times, all storing a compile-time constant that
/// the very next statements overwrite. (On the `js_object_alloc_class_inline_keys`
/// allocation path the slots are ALREADY `undefined`-prefilled (#4717), making
/// the write doubly dead — but this elision does not rely on that: the

/// - **The class extends nothing** (`extends`/`extends_name`/`native_extends`/

///   its field-init phase and ctor body may then be separated by a derived
///   ctor's pre-`super()` statements, but those cannot touch `this` (TDZ), so
///   the skipped slot stays unobservable. What this condition excludes is the
///   class having its OWN super machinery in between.
/// - **No field anywhere on the class carries an initializer expression or a
///   computed key, and the class and its fields are undecorated.** Initializer
///   and key expressions run during the init phase and may legally read
///   `this.<f>` of an earlier field — eliding f's `undefined` write would let
///   them observe whatever the allocator left in the slot. All-`init: None`
///   fields mean the init phase contains no user expression at all.
/// - **Every constructor parameter is plain**: no default (a default expression
///   evaluates before the prologue and, in the general lowering, could observe
///   `this`), no rest, no decorators, no `arguments` materialization.
/// - **No setter shares a name with a prologue-assigned field** — the store
///   would dispatch to the setter instead of writing the slot, and the elided
///   `undefined` write was the only slot write.
/// - The field itself is public and non-computed (`is_private` false,
///   `key_expr` none).
///
/// The prologue is the maximal leading run of statements that
/// [`prologue_assigned_field`] recognizes as `this.<f> = <plain param>`. A
