//! Representation-selection Phase 1 (RFC `docs/representation-selection-rfc.md`):
//! canonical unboxed i32 storage for proven-integer locals.
//!
//! ## The structural inversion
//!
//! Before this phase, a proven-integer local had a canonical NaN-boxed `double`
//! slot plus a *parallel* i32 shadow slot kept in sync by dual writes
//! (`needs_i32_slot` in `stmt/let_stmt.rs`). Post-`-O3` the loop-carried value
//! stayed a `phi double` with per-iteration `fptosi`/`sitofp` LLVM could not
//! remove — the canonical representation was still the box.
//!
//! Phase 1 flips it: for a local whose representation is proven `I32` (or
//! `U32`), the i32 slot in `ctx.i32_counter_slots` IS the canonical (and only)
//! storage. No double slot in `ctx.locals`, no dual writes, no shadow-stack GC
//! binding (the value is a number, never a pointer). A boxed double is
//! *materialized* (`sitofp` / `uitofp`) only at a genuinely-boxed use site.
//!
//! ## The mechanism (what Phase 2 builds on)
//!
//! - [`SlotRep`] is the seed of the RFC's representation lattice. `Boxed` is
//!   top and always sound; a local absent from `FnCtx::local_slot_reps` is
//!   `Boxed` (exactly the pre-phase behavior).
//! - `FnCtx::local_slot_reps: HashMap<u32, SlotRep>` maps LocalId → selected
//!   representation. Entries are only ever `I32`/`U32`; the alloca they refer
//!   to lives in `ctx.i32_counter_slots` (one slot registry for canonical and
//!   parallel-shadow slots — a single source of truth).
//! - All local loads/stores route through representation-aware helpers:
//!   [`canonical_local_i32_slot`] (rep + slot query),
//!   [`load_canonical_local_boxed`] (materialize a boxed double at a boxed use
//!   site), [`store_canonical_local_from_double`] (NaN-safe entry conversion
//!   into the i32 slot). Reads that want i32 keep loading the slot from
//!   `ctx.i32_counter_slots` directly — same as the shadow model.
//!
//! ## Eligibility
//!
//! Decided at the `Stmt::Let` site (`stmt/let_stmt.rs`): the existing proven
//! `needs_i32_slot` gate (`integer_locals` ∪ `unsigned_i32_locals`, restricted
//! to index-used / strictly-i32-bounded / unsigned locals, not boxed, not
//! module-global, init in range), MINUS locals referenced inside any closure
//! body (`repsel_closure_ref_locals` — the capture machinery stays on the boxed
//! protocol), and only in function contexts that allow it
//! (`repsel_context_allows_canonical_i32`: not async, not generator, not
//! `was_plain_async` — the async-to-generator transform boxes body locals).
//! Under-approximation is free: an ineligible local simply keeps today's
//! parallel-shadow (or plain boxed) lowering.
//!
//! ## Range soundness (audited 2026-07-27)
//!
//! - `strictly_i32_bounded_locals`: every write proven i32-range (greatest
//!   fixpoint; `++`/`--` disqualifies). Sound for canonical storage.
//! - `unsigned_i32_locals`: every write a top-level `>>> 0`; `++` disqualifies.
//!   u32 bit pattern round-trips; ordinary reads materialize with `uitofp`.
//! - `int_valued_ta_locals` (merged into `integer_locals`): every write i32 or
//!   a possibly-OOB int-TA read whose every observation is ToInt32-coercing;
//!   NaN-safe entry conversion (`toint32_wrap`) keeps OOB `undefined` → 0.
//! - `loop_bounded_i32_locals` (#7110): a monotone induction variable whose
//!   reachable interval is a pair of compile-time i32 constants — single
//!   literal init, every write a `+k`/`-k` step dominated by a
//!   constant-bounded guard on the immediately enclosing loop, direction
//!   agreeing with the guard. A real range argument, not a compatibility
//!   bound: there is no reachable state in which the value leaves i32. A bare
//!   accumulator is deliberately NOT admitted — see
//!   `collectors/loop_bounded_i32.rs`.
//! - `integer_locals ∩ index_used_locals`: admission accepts `Add/Sub/Mul`
//!   chains that can in principle exceed i32 — but under the pre-phase shadow
//!   model every `LocalGet` of such a local ALREADY reads the i32 slot
//!   (`literals_vars.rs`), so canonical-i32 storage preserves the shipped,
//!   byte-exact-validated semantics for exactly the same set of locals. No new
//!   overflow surface is introduced; tightening further would drop the loop
//!   counters and index chains this phase exists for.
//!
//! Gated by `PERRY_CANONICAL_I32_LOCALS` (default on; `0`/`off`/`false`
//! reverts to the parallel-shadow model — keyed into the object cache).
//! `PERRY_REPSEL_DEBUG=1` prints one line per canonical local at compile time.

/// The context rule for a module-init / program-entry body.
///
/// ## History
///
/// Phase 1 (#6903) excluded both entry contexts (`codegen/entry.rs`) from
/// canonical selection wholesale, on the stated premise that "top-level locals
/// interleave with import/init machinery; the win lives in function bodies".
/// Phase 3a (#6909) copied the exclusion for `Str`. Neither commit records a
/// hazard — it is a scoping decision, and the premise is false for the corpus
/// Perry is measured on: 9 of the 17 `benchmarks/suite` workloads put their
/// entire hot loop at module top level, `08_string_concat`'s `result` being
/// Phase 3a's own motivating `+=` self-append shape (#7109).
///
/// ## Why lifting it for canonical i32/u32/Str is sound
///
/// An entry body is lowered by the same `stmt::lower_stmts_inner` as a function
/// body, into an ordinary straight-line LLVM function (`main` or
/// `<prefix>__init`). Every property that made the exclusion look necessary is
/// already covered by a value-level rule or is not a difference at all:
///
/// * **Module globals.** A top-level binding read from any function, method or
///   closure body — or exported — is backed by a `@perry_global_*` cell
///   (`codegen/module_globals_emit.rs`), and `!ctx.module_globals.contains_key`
///   has excluded those since Phase 1.
/// * **Block-scoped top-level lets that escape into a closure.** Those are not
///   globalized; they are boxed (`ctx.boxed_vars`) or land in
///   `repsel_closure_ref_locals` — two more pre-existing value-level rules.
/// * **The init prelude.** `mark_entry_init_boundary` splices post-init setup
///   after the GC/string-pool prelude; canonical slots are entry allocas with a
///   constant `store i32 0`, exactly like the boxed path's `TAG_UNDEFINED`
///   store, and both go through `entry_allocas_push_store`.
/// * **The module-init shadow frame.** `enable_module_init_shadow_frame` binds
///   only pointer-typed locals (`collect_pointer_typed_locals`). An `I32`/`U32`
///   local is a number and was never bound; a `Str` local does not move storage
///   at all, so its binding is untouched.
/// * **Top-level `await`.** Codegen lowers `Expr::Await` to an in-frame polling
///   loop — module init is never rewritten into a generator state machine, so
///   the async-to-generator hazard that `body_context_denial` guards does not
///   arise here.
/// * **Init unrolling.** `unroll_static_loops` refreshes local ids per copy, so
///   an unrolled init declares fresh bindings, same as an unrolled function.
/// * **Entry-only emission** (`emit_namespace_populator`,
///   `init_static_fields_*`, `emit_script_global_function_decls`,
///   `register_module_globals_as_gc_roots`) reads `@perry_global_*` cells and
///   never `ctx.locals`.
///
/// ## What is still excluded, and why
///
/// `Ptr<Shape>` receiver proofs. Phase 5a reused
/// `repsel_context_allows_canonical_i32` as its context gate, so lifting that
/// flag would silently have enabled guard-free `this.field` / `obj.field`
/// lowering in entry bodies as a side effect of an unrelated phase. That is not
/// a representation this issue measured, and #6991 is an open rooting bug in
/// exactly that position: a compiled receiver goes stale across the
/// `globalThis`-population collection, which runs around module init. So the
/// flag is split (`repsel_context_allows_ptr_shape`) and entry bodies keep
/// `Ptr<Shape>` off, still naming this rule in `--opt-report`.
