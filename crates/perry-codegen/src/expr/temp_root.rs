//! Precise rooting for expression temporaries (#6951).
//!
//! The shadow stack roots named locals. It has no slot for the values that
//! only exist between two instructions, and an LLVM SSA register is not a GC
//! root — so an accumulator array, or an already-evaluated operand waiting for
//! its sibling, dies if the sibling's evaluation collects. Conservative native
//! stack scanning hid that (see `perry-runtime/src/gc/roots/temp_roots.rs`);
//! with `PERRY_CONSERVATIVE_STACK_SCAN=off` it is a live use-after-free.
//!
//! The emission contract, in the order it must appear:
//!
//! ```text
//! %idx = call i32 @js_gc_temp_root_push(i64 <bits>)   ; before the collection point
//! ...                                                  ; anything that may collect
//! %v   = call i64 @js_gc_temp_root_get(i32 %idx)       ; ALWAYS re-read
//!        call void @js_gc_temp_root_truncate(i32 %idx) ; after the last use
//! ```
//!
//! Re-reading is mandatory, not defensive: the slot is a *mutable* root, so an
//! evacuating cycle rewrites it and the register pushed beforehand is stale.
//! That is also why this is preferable to widening conservative scanning —
//! conservative roots have to pin, precise ones can move.
//!
//! # The invariant (#7114)
//!
//! **No operand register may outlive a collection point. After the last thing
//! that can collect, every operand is either re-read from a root the collector
//! rewrote or re-derived from immutable storage — never reused.**
//!
//! A root buys three things, and they are not the same thing:
//!
//!  1. **liveness** — the object is marked instead of swept;
//!  2. **a rewritten location** — a slot evacuation updates to the new address;
//!  3. **the value the consuming call observes** — which is (2) only if the
//!     code that resumes after the safepoint *reads that location again*.
//!
//! #7114 is what dropping (3) on its own looks like. A string literal is a load
//! from a `__perry_init_strings_*` handle global that
//! `js_gc_register_global_root` registered, so it has (1) and (2) for free —
//! and `console.log("acc:" + run(1e7))` still printed an empty line, because
//! the register loaded *before* `run` held the pre-move address. Exit code 0,
//! no diagnostic, no crash.
//!
//! [`operand_protection`] is the single place that decides which of the three
//! strategies an operand needs. Both helper families in this module route
//! through it; before #7114 they answered it separately and disagreed.
