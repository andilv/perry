//! The one inline path for an existing-property store `o.k = v`.
//!
//! Every static-key, same-receiver store that no earlier specialisation took
//! (class field, POD record, scalar-replaced local, array index or length)
//! reaches [`emit_static_store_ic`], whatever its right-hand side. The emitted
//! hit is:
//!
//! ```text
//!   receiver tag test          bits ^ POINTER_TAG, top 16 bits zero
//!   small-handle test          handle > 0xFFFFF (native registry ids, proxies)
//!   ONE shape compare          u32 at handle+4 == low half of @..._packed_set
//!   the store                  handle + 16 + slot*8, slot = high half
//!   the barrier the GC needs   behind a live test of the stored bits
//! ```
//!
//! and everything else is ONE call, `js_put_value_set_packed_miss`, which runs
//! the unchanged strict-aware `[[Set]]` and publishes what it learned.
//!
//! # Evaluation order: the RHS may collect, so the receiver is read after it
//!
//! The previous static PIC admitted only a safepoint-free RHS because it
//! evaluated the reference, held the receiver in an unrooted register across
//! the RHS, and stored through it. Here the caller evaluates the target FIRST
//! (the reference is evaluated before the value, ECMA-262 §13.15.2), keeps it
//! in an operand root across the RHS (`with_operands_rooted_across`), and
//! hands this emitter the value RE-READ from that root after the RHS. Nothing
//! between that re-read and the slot store can collect: the header loads, the
//! compact-word load and the compares are plain loads, so the handle and the
//! ShapeId this code tests are the receiver's CURRENT ones — after whatever
//! moving collection or shape change the RHS caused. No expression is
//! reordered; only the point at which the receiver's shape is consulted moved,
//! and it moved to where the spec's PutValue consults it anyway.
//!
//! # What the shape compare proves, and why no other header word is read for it
//!
//! * **GC kind** (#10828, rule 3): for a POINTER-tagged value, the u32 at
//!   `+4` equals a live ShapeId only for a `GC_TYPE_OBJECT`.
//! * **Not forwarded**: a forwarding stub stores the new user address in the
//!   first eight payload bytes (`gc::types::set_forwarding_address`), so its
//!   `+4` word is the HIGH half of a user-space address — below `0x0001_0000`
//!   on every supported target, far below the ShapeId floor `0x8000_0000`. A
//!   forwarded cell therefore cannot match a primed word.
//! * **Key present, own, inline, at this slot**: the ShapeId names an
//!   immutable key list and live inline bound, and the word is published only
//!   for an inline slot (`put_value/packed_set.rs`).
//! * **Data, writable, no accessor** (#10824 / #10287, rule 1): descriptor
//!   installs transition the ShapeId; the miss entry publishes only a key the
//!   receiver's per-key descriptor summary proves plain.
//! * **Not frozen / sealed / non-extensible**: the integrity operations mint a
//!   counter-unique semantic generation, and the miss entry refuses them.
//! * **Not deleted**: #10826 makes every delete a shape transition.
//! * **Not a class object or a dictionary**: the shape's `object_kind`.
//! * **Receiver kind and no numeric proof** (charter step 3): the word is
//!   published only for a shape of kind `Ordinary`, which is exactly "a class
//!   instance, or a class-less receiver a birth site marked plain, not a
//!   typed-array prototype, carrying no Array-subclass numeric proof"
//!   (`perry_runtime::object::shapes::store_kind`). A class-less exotic or
//!   native-module receiver is `OrdinaryUnmarked`; a proof-carrying one is
//!   `OrdinaryNumericProof`; both are other ShapeIds.
//! * **Not a Proxy**: a Proxy is a POINTER-tagged id in the handle band, below
//!   `0x100000`, so the small-handle test refuses it before any load.
//!
//! # Nothing is re-read per object
//!
//! Until charter step 3 the receiver kind and the Array-subclass numeric
//! proof lived only on the object, and the hit re-read `class_id` and
//! `_reserved` on every store. Both are now shape kinds (see above): every
//! operation that changes either moves the receiver to another ShapeId, so the
//! one compare proves them. `_reserved` is still loaded, for the barrier
//! below only.
//!
//! # The barrier
//!
//! A store of a JSValue into an object slot owes the GC exactly what
//! `emit_jsvalue_slot_store_pointer_tested` owes it, and uses the same stem
//! (`put.pic`) so the barrier census verifies this site:
//!
//! * pointer-bearing value (`emit_may_carry_heap_pointer_check`, a superset of
//!   the runtime's own test): the string alias demotion, the GC layout note
//!   when the receiver's layout state / typed-layout bit says the note can act
//!   (`_reserved & 0xD000`; a `GC_LAYOUT_UNKNOWN` receiver without a typed
//!   descriptor is fully scanned, and `layout_note_slot` returns at once for
//!   it), and `js_write_barrier_slot_validated_parent` — the remembered-set
//!   insert AND the incremental-mark shading — behind
//!   `emit_parent_may_need_remembering_check` (TENURED parent OR a live
//!   incremental cycle).
//! * a NaN-boxed non-pointer (`undefined`, a boolean, an int32, an inline
//!   string): no barrier, but a typed-layout receiver (`INTACT`) may declare
//!   the slot raw-f64, which such bits contradict, so the note runs there.
//! * a plain double: nothing. It is raw-f64-compatible with every typed slot
//!   and pointer-free (`layout_note_slot`'s #5094 fast `Conforms`).
//!
//! No value is trusted from its static type: the only static skip is LLVM
//! folding these tests for a constant.
