    // Issue #70/#73/#128: guard against non-pointer receivers

    // Previously used a Darwin mimalloc heap-window check
    // (`> 2 TB && < 128 TB`). On aarch64-linux-android (issue
    // #128) Bionic Scudo allocations live far below 2 TB, so

    // The receiver-tag test, in the cheapest form the key allows.
    //
    // `.length` is the one key with a heap-STRING arm below, so it is the one
    // key whose test must admit BOTH pointer-ish tags — POINTER (0x7FFD) and
    // STRING (0x7FFF). Collapsing them costs real instructions: LLVM folds
    // `(bits >> 48) & 0xFFFD == 0x7FFD` back into a 64-bit mask and a 64-bit
    // compare, so the emitted test is two 10-byte `movabs`, a `mov`, an `and`,
    // a `cmp` and the branch — SIX instructions and 20 bytes of immediates,
    // measured on the k1 fixture at v0.5.1618.
    //
    // Every OTHER key gets the exact POINTER test. A heap string that fails it
    // now reaches `js_object_get_field_ic_nonptr`, whose heap-string arm masks
    // the tag off and calls the same by-name helper the object exit used to
    // reach — the same answer, one branch earlier instead of four loads later.
    //
    // MEASURED: this is worth ZERO instructions today, and it is still the
    // right test. InstCombine canonicalises `(x >> 48) == 0x7FFD` straight
    // back into `x & 0xFFFF_0000_0000_0000 == 0x7FFD_0000_0000_0000`, so the
    // emitted code is the same `mov`/`and`/`cmp` pair of 10-byte `movabs`
    // either way — only the mask constant changes, 0xFFFD to 0xFFFF. Writing
    // the compare on a TRUNCATED tag (`trunc i64 ... to i32`) does not defeat
    // the fold either; both forms were checked in the k1 fixture's
