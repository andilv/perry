///
/// # Forwarding stubs
///
/// An array that grows past its capacity moves, and its old head becomes a
/// stub: `GC_FLAG_FORWARDED` set and the live head's address in the first
/// payload word, where `length` was. Every binding the growing code wrote
/// through is re-pointed, but one it did not — a field holding the array
/// while `obj.items.push(x)` grew it, an alias — keeps the stub until a
/// collection heals it, and a loop that allocates nothing never collects. On
/// the natively compiled `tsc`, a plain-array test alone still left 477,202
/// `array_length` misses to the handler, 380,278 of them at one site. With
/// `follow_stub`, a stub follows ONE edge here, exactly as
/// `index_get/guarded_array.rs` does: the forwarding word is trusted only once
/// it is a heap address above the handle band, and the destination is
/// re-checked as a live plain Array before its `length` is read; that left
/// 1,387. A longer or malformed chain takes `other_label`, where
/// `clean_arr_ptr` follows the whole chain and compresses it to one edge, so
/// the next read heals here. All of this is on the refusal edge: a live plain
/// Array's read is the header test and the load, nothing more.
///
/// The inline tower follows stubs; the full-outline site does not. That mode
/// exists to keep each site small (#5391), and the three extra blocks cost it

/// arrays, the full-outline arm with the follow ran at ~1450 ms against
/// ~1040 ms without it (the emitted hot path is the same instructions; the
/// larger CFG changed the loop's register allocation). A stub there takes the

///

    // split is not cosmetic — see `pget.recv_other` below for the +4
    // instructions per HIT that a single shared exit cost.
    //
    // The ShapeId compare is the whole receiver classification. Five guards
    // that used to sit between the small-handle test and the load are gone
    // because the fact each one tested is now a function of the ShapeId word:
    // "is this site primed?" and the overflow-bit test (#10833: an unprimed
    // word is `PACKED_GET_EMPTY`, a spill entry is flipped out of the ShapeId
    // range), the GC-kind load (#10828, rule 3), the descriptor flag (#10824,
    // rule 1) and the `TAG_HOLE` compare (#10826: delete is a shape
    // transition). Each is argued at the point where it used to be emitted.
    //
    // The arms were not cheap to keep: ~37 basic blocks, ~177 pre-RS4GC IR
    // instructions and 6-7 call sites per site, each call a statepoint whose
    // live GC values are written into `.perry_gcmap`. On @babel/parser the

    // Issue #70/#73/#128: guard against non-pointer receivers

    // NaN-box: real heap references have high-16-bits POINTER_TAG
    // (0x7FFD) or STRING_TAG (0x7FFF). `AND 0xFFFD` collapses both
    // to 0x7FFD; everything else (undefined/null/bool=0x7FFC,
    // int32=0x7FFE, bigint=0x7FFA, plain f64 like 0.0 globalThis
    // or 3.14, corrupt bit-patterns like 0x00FF_0000_0000 read as
    // a BufferHeader) falls through to the slow entry, whose tag
    // ladder throws for a nullish receiver (#462) and routes every
    // other tag to the by-name helper.
    //
    // Previously used a Darwin mimalloc heap-window check
    // (`> 2 TB && < 128 TB`). On aarch64-linux-android (issue
    // #128) Bionic Scudo allocations live far below 2 TB, so

    // key whose test must admit BOTH pointer-ish tags — POINTER (0x7FFD) and
    // STRING (0x7FFF). Collapsing them costs real instructions: LLVM folds
    // `(bits >> 48) & 0xFFFD == 0x7FFD` back into a 64-bit mask and a 64-bit
    // compare, so the emitted test is two 10-byte `movabs`, a `mov`, an `and`,
    // a `cmp` and the branch — SIX instructions and 20 bytes of immediates,
    // measured on the k1 fixture at v0.5.1618.
    //
    // Every OTHER key gets the exact POINTER test. A heap string that fails it
    // now reaches `js_object_get_field_ic_nonptr`, whose heap-string arm masks
    // the tag off and calls the same by-name helper the object exit used to
    // reach — the same answer, one branch earlier instead of four loads later.
    //
    // MEASURED: this is worth ZERO instructions today, and it is still the
    // right test. InstCombine canonicalises `(x >> 48) == 0x7FFD` straight
    // back into `x & 0xFFFF_0000_0000_0000 == 0x7FFD_0000_0000_0000`, so the
    // emitted code is the same `mov`/`and`/`cmp` pair of 10-byte `movabs`
    // either way — only the mask constant changes, 0xFFFD to 0xFFFF. Writing
    // the compare on a TRUNCATED tag (`trunc i64 ... to i32`) does not defeat
    // the fold either; both forms were checked in the k1 fixture's
