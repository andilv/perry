//! The own-override guard for builtin calls HIR already folded (#10943).
//!
//! `lower_call/property_get/own_override_guard.rs` guards the calls codegen's
//! ordered chain lowers. It is not where most of them are: HIR folds
//! `m.get(k)`, `s.has(v)`, `a.push(x)` on a proven receiver into dedicated
//! nodes (`Expr::MapGet`, `Expr::SetHas`, `Expr::ArraySlice`, …) long before
//! codegen sees a `PropertyGet` call, and those nodes lower straight to
//! `js_map_get`/`js_set_has`/`js_array_push`. Measured on #10943's
//! differential: with only the chain guarded, **3** guard calls were emitted
//! and 16 of 30 rows stayed wrong, because the rows go through the fold.
//!
//! So the same diamond is applied here, at the ONE place every folded node
//! passes through — `lower_expr`'s dispatch — rather than in each of the forty
//! lowerings. The table below is what a node has to answer to be guarded: its
//! receiver, the method name a user could shadow, and its arguments.
//!
//! The rules are the chain guard's, unchanged:
//!
//! * the guard only CHOOSES A BRANCH — the other side is the universal
//!   dispatcher, which finds an own or inherited user method. It never
//!   resolves the property and calls it, because an own slot can hold a
//!   builtin thunk that dispatches by name again;
//! * the receiver is materialised once when re-evaluating it could be
//!   observed, and re-read in both arms;
//! * arguments are lowered inside each arm, because a diamond runs one arm.
