//! Design step 4: link-time ("static") ShapeIds.
//!
//! The driver names every compiler-visible class birth shape BY CONTENT —
//! the packed key names, the key count, the birth live bound, class or
//! literal prototype, and the typed masks when the class has a typed layout —
//! and assigns each distinct content one id in the static band (a
//! power-of-two band sized to the program, within the reserved
//! `perry_abi::STATIC_SHAPE_ID_COUNT` ids from `SHAPE_ID_BASE`). Equal content
//! means an equal slot layout (and the same class id), which is exactly what
//! the runtime already shares, so one id can never name two layouts. Class
//! NAMES never identify a shape: an importer's stub keys can differ from the
//! definer's (#5094), and then the two contents simply get two ids.
//!
//! Adoption is the runtime's: module init hands the id to the ordinary mint
//! as `requested` (`js_object_shape_id_for_class_keys_static`,
//! `js_object_shape_id_for_class_keys`), which mints it on a by-facts miss and
//! otherwise returns the existing id; a refused id aborts (ids are by
//! content, so a refusal is an invariant violation). Births stamp what the
//! mint RETURNED; only guards compare against the static id as an immediate.
//!
//! The content of a birth comes from ONE function, [`class_birth`], which the
//! string pool uses to emit the mint and the driver's pre-pass uses (through
//! [`crate::module_birth_shapes`]) to collect every module's contents.
