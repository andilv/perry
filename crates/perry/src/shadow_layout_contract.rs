//! The shadow-stack layout contract between `perry-codegen` and
//! `perry-runtime` (#7088).
//!
//! Generated code writes GC roots *inline*: it computes the address of a
//! `ShadowEntry` from the `ShadowStackState` pointer `js_shadow_frame_enter`
//! returned, using hardcoded field offsets, and stores the two words itself.
//! `perry-codegen` deliberately does not depend on `perry-runtime`, so those
//! offsets exist twice.
//!
//! Nothing in either crate's own build fails if one copy moves. The result
//! would not be a compile error or a crash: the emitted code would write a
//! live root into the wrong word of the wrong structure, and the collector
//! would read a stale or bogus one — a silent wrong-answer bug of exactly the
//! kind this campaign keeps finding.
//!
//! `perry` depends on both crates, so this is where the two copies can be
//! compared. It runs in `cargo-test`, i.e. per PR, unlike the integration
//! suites under `crates/*/tests/`.
