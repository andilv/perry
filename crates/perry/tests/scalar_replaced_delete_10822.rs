//! Regression: `delete o.k` on a NON-ESCAPING receiver must actually remove
//! the property — a later read must answer `undefined`, not the deleted value.
//!
//! Issue #10822. `const o = { a: 1, c: 3 }; delete o.c; String(o.c)` printed
//! `"3"`. Not "the property is still there": the read returned the value the
//! property held *before* the delete, `o.c === undefined` was `false`, and
//! nothing in the output said anything was wrong.
//!
//! The mechanism is escape analysis plus scalar replacement, not the delete
//! representation (it reproduced identically with `PERRY_OBJECT_TOMBSTONES=0`)
//! and not the `Ptr<Shape>` proven path (`--opt-report` says `0 selected /
//! 1 denied`: ptr-shape rule 5 disables the whole module on a `delete`).
//!
//! `collectors/escape_check.rs` stripped `Expr::Delete` in its generic unary
//! arm and handed the inner `PropertyGet` to the "plain declared-field read —
//! safe" arm, which returns early WITHOUT visiting the bare `LocalGet`. The
//! receiver therefore never escaped: `stmt/let_stmt.rs` scalar-replaced it,
//! elided the heap object entirely, and gave each observed field its own
//! alloca. The delete still emitted
//! `js_object_delete_field_value(<dummy slot>, "c")` against the
//! never-populated `ctx.locals[id]` alloca, where the deliberate "a primitive
//! receiver no-ops to `true`" guard made it a silent nothing — and the read
//! loaded the `c` alloca, which still held `3`.
//!
//! That also explains the fragility in the report. Every "repair" —
//! `Object.keys(o)`, `JSON.stringify(o)`, `objs.push(o)`, `"c" in o` — passes
//! `o` somewhere as a value, reaching the bare-`LocalGet` arm that escapes the
//! candidate. A `delete` alone never did.
//!
//! This is the REMOVAL sibling of the read rule (#10689) and the write rules
//! (#9024 `PropertySet`/`PutValueSet`, #9460 `PropertyUpdate`).
//!
//! Fixtures are `.js` so `delete` of a plain key and a holey array literal are
//! valid source with no `as any` casts; a cast on the receiver would route the
//! access through the dynamic path and miss the lowering the bug lived in.
//! The two "masking" programs are pinned as tests of their own: they were
//! already correct before the fix, so they are the ones that tell "fixed"
//! apart from "masked".
