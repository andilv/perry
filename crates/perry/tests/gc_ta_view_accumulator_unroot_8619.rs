//! #8619 — a proven-Number f64 accumulator derived from a typed-array read is
//! un-rooted (raw double, not a nanbox GC root) without corrupting the heap.
//!
//! A function that reads a spec-ABI-proven typed-array parameter and folds the
//! elements into an accumulator (`let x = arr[i] + 1.0; s = s + x`) used to keep
//! BOTH `x` and `s` in nanbox GC-root slots with a per-write root barrier, even
//! though every value is a genuine Number (a typed-array element is a Number
//! in-bounds and `undefined` — never a pointer — out of range, which `+`
//! launders into a Number). #8619 teaches the number-by-construction fixpoint
//! that a `TaPtr` view read is Number-or-`undefined`, so the accumulator drops
//! its root slot and its arithmetic becomes an inline `fadd`.
//!
//! This is a differential test with NO node oracle. The same program is compiled
//! twice from identical source:
//!
//!   * `PERRY_NUMBER_BY_CONSTRUCTION=0` — the fact is empty, so the accumulator
//!     stays a NaN-boxed GC root updated through `js_dynamic_string_or_number_add`
//!     (the pre-#8619 lowering);
//!   * unset (default) — the accumulator is proven Number by construction and
//!     kept in a raw `double` slot with an inline `fadd`.
//!
//! Both binaries run under every moving-collector configuration and MUST produce
//! byte-identical output. If the un-rooting were unsound — if the accumulator
//! could ever hold a pointer the collector no longer tracks — a relocating minor
//! would leave a stale pointer and the checksum would diverge (or the run would
//! crash) in the default arm only. The interleaved `keep` array forces nursery
//! collections while the un-rooted accumulator is live, so the collector is
//! actually exercised against the changed frame.
//!
//! `keep` pushes a fresh OBJECT rather than an unboxed number ON PURPOSE, and
//! that is load-bearing: with plain numbers the fixture measured
//! `copied_objects=0` over a single GC cycle, so nothing was ever relocated and
//! the differential degenerated into an arithmetic comparison. With objects it
//! measures ~100 copied objects per cycle across ~600 cycles. If you shrink this
//! fixture, re-check `PERRY_GC_DIAG=1 … | grep copied_objects` first: a GC test
//! that never moves anything cannot fail for the reason it exists.
