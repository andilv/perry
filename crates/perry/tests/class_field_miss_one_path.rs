//! A class-field read the inline guard cannot prove takes the One Path read,
//! and a by-name overwrite keeps the typed layout that guard reads.
//!
//! `this.x` inside a class or object-literal method compiles to a class-field
//! read: an inline pre-check of the receiver against the class's birth shape
//! (the exact ShapeId, which carries the slots' `F64` lanes), then a slot load. Two things sent
//! ordinary receivers past it, on every read, into a site-less by-name walk
//! (~1,300 instructions where the same read elsewhere costs ~100-300):
//!
//! * a by-name overwrite of an existing key (`o.d = k` at a site that meets the
//!   object through a parameter or a module `const`) declared the object's
//!   whole layout unknown, which cleared the layout the pre-check reads, so
//!   the pre-check of every later `this.a` missed (the layout is now the
//!   ShapeId itself; an overwrite must keep it);
//! * a receiver of another shape reading the method's key (an `Object.create`
//!   child of the literal, reading through `this`) is never the pre-check's,
//!   and the miss arm walked by name instead of asking the receiver's shape.
//!
//! Both are asserted from the receiver-route census (`PERRY_RECV_ROUTE_COUNT=1`
//! at compile time; one `PERRY_RECV_ROUTES` line at exit), with the output
//! checked against the values node prints.
