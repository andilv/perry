//! Regression test for #7024: under an explicit `PERRY_GC_HEAP_LIMIT`, a
//! compiled program must still run the **copying** minor.
//!
//! `gc_check_trigger`'s deferral arm hands an allocation-point nursery trigger
//! to the next precise-root safepoint, which is the only way the copying
//! (relocating) young-gen minor #7019 shipped ever runs on the automatic path.
//! That deferral used to be guarded by an absolute committed-arena cap derived
//! from `budget_scaled(128 MB, 1, 4, 2 MB)` — byte-for-byte the formula behind
//! `gc_trigger_absolute_ceiling_bytes()`. Under any heap budget small enough
//! for the ceiling to reach the 16 MB nursery cap, the two collapse to one
//! number, and since a nursery trigger is due exactly when
//! `arena_total_bytes() >= trigger` while the deferral required
//! `arena_total_bytes() < cap`, the two predicates became exact complements:
//! the deferral was unreachable, control fell through to the alloc-point minor
//! under `ManualGcScanGuard::force_full_scan()`, and the collector reported
//!
//! ```text
//! [gc-copy-minor] eligible=false fallback=conservative_stack
//! ```
//!
//! for the whole run. Measured on the representation corpus at
//! `PERRY_GC_HEAP_LIMIT=8` before the fix: **0 of 22 files ran a single copying
//! minor**, while the same 22 files collected on 13. So a heap-limited
//! deployment — every small container, every watch-class device, and every arm
//! of the GC stress matrix that uses the pressure knob — silently ran the
//! *pre*-#7019 non-moving collector.
//!
//! What this test pins is the observable that distinguishes those two worlds:
//! a non-in-place copying minor relocated at least one object. Asserting "a GC
//! cycle happened" does not — the broken build collected too. Exit 0 does not
//! either; the broken build exited 0.
