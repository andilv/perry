//! #7055 — the relocating young collection must not invalidate a closure's
//! own `this_closure` pointer.
//!
//! A closure body reaches its captured variables through
//! `js_closure_get_capture_bits(%this_closure, idx)`, where `%this_closure` is
//! the LLVM parameter the caller passed — a register value no root enumeration
//! can see. The shipped default runs an evacuating young collection at loop
//! back-edge polls (`js_gc_loop_safepoint`) with PRECISE roots and no
//! conservative native-stack scan, so a closure relocated while its own body is
//! on the stack leaves that register pointing into from-space. From-space is
//! reset at the end of the same cycle and immediately handed back to the
//! mutator, so the next capture access reads a *different* object's header:
//! `js_closure_get_capture_bits` finds the index beyond that object's
//! `capture_count` and returns **0**. Box pointer 0 is not a registered box, so
//! every later boxed-capture read yields `undefined` and every boxed-capture
//! write is silently dropped.
//!
//! In an `async fn` the casualty is the generator state machine itself. Its
//! `__gen_state` local is a boxed capture, so the `state = <next>` store at the
//! end of a resumed state body went nowhere; the following `await` then resumed
//! into the state it had just finished and **ran one loop iteration twice**.
//! That is #7055's "deterministic wrong answer in the shipped default": a
//! checksum off by exactly one request's fold, the same constant at every
//! workload length, only when `copied_objects > 0`.
//!
//! The program below is the reduced form of the issue's `w5_srv_scale.ts`.
//! Every arm must reproduce node 26.5.0 exactly:
//!
//! ```text
//! $ node --experimental-strip-types main.ts
//! calls:150
//! checksum:-342133776
//! ```
//!
//! # Why the arms are a nursery-cap sweep
//!
//! Whether a *relocating* minor lands inside the state-machine body at all
//! depends on where the nursery happens to fill, so any single configuration is
//! a coin flip on a given host — precisely the "passes either way" trap. The
//! sweep removes the coin flip: `PERRY_GC_SCAVENGE_NURSERY_MB` is a pacing knob
//! only (it moves the trigger threshold, it does not change what the collector
//! does), so one binary run under a spread of caps puts a relocating minor at
//! many different points of the program. Every arm must be node-exact; the test
//! is red if **any** of them is not.
//!
//! Measured against the unfixed compiler on this program: caps 1, 2 and 8 MB
//! print `calls:151`, caps 4 and 16 MB and the default do not. With the fix all
//! of them are node-exact. `PERRY_GEN_GC=0` (full mark-sweep, never moves) is
//! the control — correct before and after, so a green run cannot be inertness.
