//! turnloop P5: `node:http` / `node:https` servers on turnloop handles.
//!
//! # What this replaces
//!
//! | hyper / tokio | turnloop |
//! |---|---|
//! | a `tokio::spawn` accept loop per listening server | one multishot `accept_start` |
//! | a `tokio::spawn`ed `http1::Builder::serve_connection` per connection | one multishot `read_start` + [`conn`]'s state machine |
//! | `hyper`'s HTTP/1 parser and framer | `turnloop_http::http1::{Decoder, Encoder}` (sans-I/O) |
//! | `tokio_rustls::TlsAcceptor` per HTTPS connection | `perry_ext_net::turnloop_tls`'s unbuffered session |
//! | an `mpsc` carrying `(req, res)` to the main thread, plus `notify_main_thread()` | a queue on this thread, because the codec already runs on it |
//! | a `oneshot` carrying the response shape back to the hyper task | `res.end()` encoding and submitting the write directly |
//!
//! # Why sans-I/O rather than `turnloop_http::asynchronous`
//!
//! `turnloop-http` also ships a futures-io server driver. It needs a
//! `turnloop_io::LocalExecutor`, and a `LocalExecutor` **constructs its own
//! `Driver`** and silently drops every completion whose token it did not issue
//! (`Shared::dispatch` returns early unless the token's top bit is set). Perry
//! already owns a `turnloop::Loop` and routes P1 net, P2 process and P3 timer
//! tokens through it, so adopting the executor would mean either a second loop
//! — the mixed-transport deadlock P1 had to paper over — or losing those
//! completions. The sans-I/O codecs have no such coupling, and they are the
//! part that actually replaces hyper.
//!
//! # Ordering, and why JS never runs inside a turn
//!
//! The sink runs inside `dispatch_staged`, which the event pump calls after a
//! turn has returned. It decodes, but it does **not** call JS: a fully decoded
//! request is pushed onto the server's queue and the existing pump
//! (`js_node_http_server_process_pending`) runs the handler on its own tick,
//! exactly where it ran when hyper delivered requests over an `mpsc`. So the
//! event-loop phase order the gap suite pins is unchanged; what disappears is
//! the thread hop, the channel and the cross-thread notify.
//!
//! # GC
//!
//! A connection holds decoded head/body bytes as owned `Vec<u8>`s and the two
//! handle ids of the request it produced. No JS value and no heap pointer
//! reaches the driver, and this module registers no root scanner: the
//! `IncomingMessage` / `ServerResponse` handles it allocates are scanned by
//! `perry-ext-http`'s existing `scan_http_server_roots`, which is also why a
//! request is carried as ids rather than as `f64` closures (#8082).
