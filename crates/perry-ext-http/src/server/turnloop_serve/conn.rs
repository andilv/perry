//! One turnloop-backed HTTP/1.1 server connection (P5).
//!
//! The whole exchange lives on the loop-owning thread: bytes arrive as a
//! `NET_DATA` completion, `turnloop_http::http1::Decoder` turns them into a
//! request, the request is queued for the existing main-thread pump, and
//! `res.end()` encodes the response and submits the write. There is no task,
//! no channel and no cross-thread notify anywhere on that path.
//!
//! What the sink may and may not do is the load-bearing rule: it runs inside
//! `dispatch_staged`, so it may allocate Rust state and register handles, but
//! it must **not** run JS. A decoded request is therefore pushed onto the
//! server's queue and dispatched by `js_node_http_server_process_pending` on
//! its own tick, exactly where hyper's `mpsc` delivered it.
