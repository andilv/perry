# Contributing to Perry

Thanks for your interest in Perry. This document covers everything you need to land a PR — what to build, how to test, and what the review flow looks like.

For building and installing Perry as a user, see [README.md](README.md#installation). For runtime/compiler architecture, see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md). This file is about *contributing*, not using.

## Ways to contribute

All of these are welcome and none are ranked:

- **Fix a bug.** Check the [issue tracker](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/issues), especially [`good first issue`](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/labels/good%20first%20issue) and [`help wanted`](https://github.com/PerryTS/perry/labels/help%20wanted).
- **Close a TypeScript parity gap.** The [gap test suite](test-files/) tracks divergences from `node --experimental-strip-types`; CLAUDE.md's "TypeScript Parity Status" table is the current scoreboard.
- **Add a platform backend or widget.** See the "To add a new widget" and "Native UI" sections in [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md).
- **Improve docs or examples.** Everything under [`docs/src/`](docs/src/) and [`docs/examples/`](docs/examples/) is fair game.
- **Report an issue.** File one even if you don't have a fix — reproducers are themselves a contribution.

## Building from source

Prerequisites match what CI installs — see [`.github/workflows/test.yml`](.github/workflows/test.yml) for the authoritative list. In short:

| Component | Version | Needed for |
|---|---|---|
| Rust | stable (≥ 1.94) | Everything. The workspace pins no toolchain, so an older `stable` fails deep in the dependency graph with a `sqlx@0.9.0 requires rustc 1.94.0` MSRV error rather than a clear message — `rustup update stable` fixes it. |
| Rust nightly + `rust-src` | latest | tvOS / watchOS cross-compile only (`-Zbuild-std`) |
| Node.js | see [`.node-version`](.node-version) | Parity tests (`run_parity_tests.sh`). Use that exact version — an older Node makes the harness classify tests `node_fail` and silently DROP them from the gate instead of failing. |
| C linker | any | Linking compiled binaries (`xcode-select --install` / `build-essential` / MSVC) |
| **libclang** | any | `bindgen`, via the `libsqlite3-sys` build script. Without it the build dies with `Unable to find libclang`. Debian/Ubuntu: `libclang-dev`; Fedora: `clang-devel`; Arch: `clang`. If it lives somewhere non-standard, point at it with `LIBCLANG_PATH=/path/to/dir` (and, if bindgen then can't find `stdarg.h`, `BINDGEN_EXTRA_CLANG_ARGS="-isystem /path/to/clang/<ver>/include"`). |
| clang | ≥ 15 | Perry's own LLVM codegen shells out to `clang -c`. Separate from the linker above — see the [installation guide](docs/src/getting-started/installation.md). `perry doctor` verifies it. |

Platform-specific extras — only required if you're touching that backend:

- **macOS UI** (`perry-ui-macos`): Xcode Command Line Tools
- **iOS / tvOS / watchOS**: Xcode + matching SDKs; `rustup target add aarch64-apple-ios-sim`
- **Android** (`perry-ui-android`): Android NDK (`$ANDROID_NDK_HOME` or `$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/*`); `rustup target add aarch64-linux-android`
- **Linux UI** (`perry-ui-gtk4`): `libgtk-4-dev libadwaita-1-dev libpulse-dev pkg-config` (Xvfb for headless UI tests)
- **Windows UI** (`perry-ui-windows`): MSVC (`ilammy/msvc-dev-cmd` or a `vcvars64.bat` session)

Build the default (platform-independent) workspace and run the affected crates'
fast unit tests:

```bash
cargo build --release
./scripts/test_affected_crates.sh --base origin/main
```

The runner includes committed, staged, and unstaged paths relative to the base
revision; stage new files before running it because untracked paths are ignored.
Use `--dry-run` to inspect its per-crate Cargo commands, or set
`PERRY_TEST_BASE` to change the default base. It mirrors CI's
`scripts/ci_test_scope.py` selection and unit-target filtering, including the
single-threaded `perry-runtime` run. It deliberately skips integration tests
under `crates/*/tests/`; CI runs those through its scoped and nightly jobs.
Never replace it with `cargo test --workspace`: Perry's per-crate feature sets
must remain isolated.

For a faster inner loop, `cargo check -p perry` (correctness only) or
`cargo build --profile perry-dev -p perry` (optimized local dev build). The
`.a` static archives now come from dedicated wrapper crates — build them with
`cargo build --release -p perry-runtime-static -p perry-stdlib-static` when you
need `libperry_{runtime,stdlib}.a`. See `docs/src/contributing/building.md` for
the full dev/release/dist taxonomy and the slim `--features dev-cli` CLI (#5422).

The full README [Development](README.md#development) section has more `cargo run` recipes (HIR dumps, per-crate rebuilds).

For fixture-only parity reruns, `PERRY_SKIP_BUILD=1 ./run_parity_tests.sh`
reuses `PERRY_BIN` and the matching runtime/stdlib archives from
`PERRY_RUNTIME_DIR` (or the binary's directory) with auto-optimization disabled.
Rebuild instead whenever Rust or Cargo inputs, or compiler, runtime, stdlib, or
required extension sources differ; reuse does not prove that prebuilt artifacts
match the checkout.

## Making changes

### What goes in a PR

- One logical change. Small PRs land faster. If you find yourself writing "also, I fixed …", split.
- Tests. New behavior needs a test; a bug fix needs a regression test. For compiler changes, drop a `.ts` file under [`test-files/`](test-files/) exercising the path. For runtime/stdlib, `#[test]` in the relevant crate.
- **A new test file must be registered in its suite's registry, or it will not run.** Most suites glob their inputs, but four read an explicit list — a `test_gap_gc_*` witness needs a line in [`test-parity/gc_repsel_corpus.txt`](test-parity/gc_repsel_corpus.txt), a feature probe needs an entry in `test-features/feature_matrix.toml`, a compiler-output fixture needs an entry in `benchmarks/compiler_output/workloads.toml`, and a Rust test file below a suite root needs a `mod` declaration. An unregistered file is not a failing test, it is *no test at all*: your PR goes green having run nothing. `python3 scripts/check_test_registration.py` catches this in `lint` in under a second; `--list` names every registry. Full page: [`docs/src/testing/test-registration.md`](docs/src/testing/test-registration.md).
- Docs where user-visible. New CLI flags, new perry.toml fields, new stdlib APIs → update [`docs/src/`](docs/src/).

### What does NOT go in a PR (maintainer handles these at merge)

- **Do not bump `[workspace.package] version`** in `Cargo.toml`.
- **Do not edit `**Current Version:**`** at the top of `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Do not add a "Recent Changes" entry** to `CLAUDE.md` or `CHANGELOG.md`.

Perry releases frequently — often several patch versions between a PR being opened and merged. If contributors bump the version on their branch, those bumps conflict on merge day through no fault of the contributor. The maintainer folds version + changelog metadata in when landing your PR, so it always matches the actually-shipped release.

### Commit messages

We loosely follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) — not enforced, but you'll see `feat:` / `fix:` / `docs:` / `chore:` / `refactor:` prefixes in the log. Match that style and your PR reads better in the changelog. A good commit message answers "why" more than "what"; the diff already shows what.

### Claiming an issue

Comment on the issue saying you'd like to take it. We'll assign it to you. If you go quiet for a week or two, we may un-assign to let someone else pick it up — no hard feelings, just keeping the board moving.

## Running CI's checks locally

Most red PRs come from gates that `cargo build` never looks at — a file
that crossed the 2000-line cap, fmt drift, or an unbarriered GC store site.
Run the fast, non-compiling subset with:

```bash
./scripts/pre-tag-check.sh --quick
```

That is every gate in the `lint` job that doesn't compile anything, so it
costs seconds. Drop `--quick` to add the docs linter, `cargo check`, and
Clippy; it also runs `cargo deny` when installed. The script prints every
failure in one pass rather than one per push.

Behavioral changes (HIR, codegen, runtime) also need the conformance suite,
which diffs compiled programs byte-for-byte against Node:

```bash
./scripts/run_gap_tests.sh                          # 401 tests; ~1h serially
./scripts/run_doc_tests.sh                          # Compile + run every docs/examples/*.ts
```

**Use the Node version pinned in `.node-version`, not whatever you have.**
Node is the oracle the suite diffs against, so its version is a correctness
input: on a Node too old for a test, *node* fails, the harness classifies the
test `node_fail`, and it is dropped from the run instead of going red. CI sat
on Node 22 while the suite grew Node 24/26 features and hid 14 tests that way.

Any PR touching `crates/` also needs a `changelog.d/<PR-number>-<slug>.md`
fragment; see [changelog.d/README.md](changelog.d/README.md).

UI doc-tests launch real windows. On headless hosts, wrap in `xvfb-run -a` (Linux) or rely on `PERRY_UI_TEST_MODE=1` which auto-exits after one frame.
